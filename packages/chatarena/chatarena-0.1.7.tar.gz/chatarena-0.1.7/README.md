ChatArena is a Python library designed to facilitate communication and collaboration between multiple large language
models (LLMs).
It provides the following features:

- **Language Game Environments**: it provides a framework for creating multi-agent language game environments, and a set
  of general-purposed language-driven environments.
- **Infrastructure for Multi-LLM Interaction**: it allows you to quickly create multiple LLM-powered player agents, and
  enables seamlessly communication between them.
- **User-friendly Interfaces**: it provides both Web browser UI and command line interface (CLI) to develop (prompt
  engineer) your LLM players to succeed in the environment.

## Getting Started

[![Demo button](docs/images/demo_button.svg)](https://chatarena-chatarena-demo.hf.space)

### Installation

Requirements:

- Python >= 3. 7
- OpenAI API key (optional, for using GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4 as an LLM agent)

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install chatarena
```

or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chatarena/chatarena
cd chatarena
pip install .
```

To use GPT-3 as an LLM agent, set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Launch the Demo Locally

The quickest way to see ChatArena in action is via the demo Web UI.
To launch the demo on your local machine, you first need to git clone the repository and install it from source
(see above instruction). Then run the following command in the root directory of the repository:

```shell
gradio app.py
```

This will launch a demo server for ChatArena and you can access it via http://127.0.0.1:7860/ in your browser.

## Basic Usage

### Key Concepts

- **Player**: a player is an agent that can interact with other players in a game environment. A player can be a human
  or
  a large language model (LLM). A player is defined by its name, its backend, and its role.
    - **Backend**: a backend is a Python class that defines how a player interacts with other players. A backend can be
      a
      human, a LLM, or a combination of them. A backend is defined by its name, its type, and its parameters.
- **Environment**: an environment is a Python class that defines the rules of a game. An environment is defined by its
  name, its type, and its parameters.
    - **Moderator**: a moderator is a Python class that defines how the game is played. A moderator is defined by its
      name,
      its type, and its parameters.
- **Arena**: an arena is a Python class that defines the overall game. An arena is defined by its name, its type, and
  its
  parameters.

### Step 1: Define Multiple Players with LLM Backend

```python
from chatarena.agent import Player
from chatarena.backends import OpenAIChat

# Describe the environment (which is shared by all players)
environment_description = "It is in a university classroom ..."

# A "Professor" player
player1 = Player(name="Professor", backend=OpenAIChat(),
                 role_desc="You are a professor in ...",
                 global_prompt=environment_description)
# A "Student" player
player2 = Player(name="Student", backend=OpenAIChat(),
                 role_desc="You are a student who is interested in ...",
                 global_prompt=environment_description)
# A "Teaching Assistant" player
player3 = Player(name="Teaching assistant", backend=OpenAIChat(),
                 role_desc="You are a teaching assistant of module ...",
                 global_prompt=environment_description)
```

### Step 2: Create a Language Game Environment

You can also create a language model-driven environment and add it to the ChatArena:

```python
from chatarena.environments.conversation import Conversation

env = Conversation(player_names=[p.name for p in [player1, player2, player3]])
```

### Step 3: Run the Language Game using Arena

Arena is a utility class to help you run language games.

```python
from chatarena.arena import Arena

arena = Arena(players=[player1, player2, player3],
              environment=env, global_prompt=environment_description)
# Run the game for 10 steps
arena.run(num_steps=10)

# Alternatively, you can run your own main loop
for _ in range(10):
    arena.step()
    # Your code goes here ...
```

You can easily save your game play history to file

```python
arena.save_history(path=...)
```

and save your game config to file

```python
arena.save_config(path=...)
```

### Other Utilities

Load Arena from config file (here we use `examples/nlp-classroom-3players.json` in this repository as an example)

```python
arena = Arena.from_config("examples/nlp-classroom-3players.json")
arena.run(num_steps=10)
```

Run the game in an interactive CLI interface

```python
arena.launch_cli()
```

## Advanced Usage

### `ModeratedConversation`: a LLM-driven Environment

We support a more advanced environment called `ModeratedConversation` that allows you to **control the game dynamics
using an LLM**.
The moderator is a special player that controls the game state transition and determines when the game ends.
For example, you can define a moderator that track the board status of a board game, and end the game when a player
wins.
You can try out our Tic-tac-toe and Rock-paper-scissors games to get a sense of how it works:

```python
# Tic-tac-toe example
Arena.from_config("examples/tic-tac-toe.json").launch_cli()

# Rock-paper-scissors example
Arena.from_config("examples/rock-paper-scissors.json").launch_cli()
```

### Creating your Custom Environment

You can define your own environment by extending the `Environment` class. Here are the general steps:

1. Define the class by inheriting from a base class and setting `type_name`, then add the class
   to [`ALL_ENVIRONMENTS`](chatarena/environments/__init__.py#L17)
2. Initialize the class by defining `__init__` method (its arguments will define the corresponding config) and
   initializing class attributes
3. Implement game mechanics in methods `step`
4. Handle game states and rewards by implementing methods such as `reset`, `get_observation`, `is_terminal`,
   and `get_rewards`
5. Develop role description prompts (and global prompt if necessary) for players using CLI or Web UI and save them to a
   config file.

We provide [a detailed tutorial](docs/tutorials/create_your_environment.md) to demonstrate how to define a custom
environment,
using the [`Chameleon` environment](chatarena/environments/chameleon.py) as example.

If you want to port an existing library's environment to ChatArena, check out [`PettingzooChess` environment](chatarena/environments/pettingzoo_chess.py) as an example.
