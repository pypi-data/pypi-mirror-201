# RHiOTS: A Framework for Evaluating Hierarchical Time Series

This repository provides the implementation of RHiOTS, a novel methodology for evaluating the robustness of HTS (hierarchical time series) forecasting algorithms on real-world datasets. It includes a comprehensive framework that extends beyond the traditional evaluation of predictive performance, enabling a more reliable method for selecting the appropriate HTSF algorithm for a given problem than existing benchmark-based approaches. Additionally, the repository provides a set of parameterizable transformations to simulate changes in the data distribution.

You can install gpforecaster as a python package
```python
pip install gpforecaster
```

## Functionality


The main functionality of this repository includes:

* **GPHF Model:** The implementation of the Gaussian Process Hierarchical Forecaster for forecasting hierarchical time series data built on top of GPyTorch.
* **Scalable Gaussian Processes:** A scalable approach to Gaussian Processes that can handle large-scale hierarchical time series datasets.
* **Automatic Forecasting:** A method for automatic time series forecasting on hierarchical data, offering robust performance even with missing data and without requiring prior knowledge.
* **Visualization Tools:** Tools for visualizing predictions, losses, and other aspects of the GPHF model.


## Getting started
The code below creates new versions of the prison dataset by applying time series augmentation transformations.

```python
import gpforecaster as gpf
import numpy as np

# Initialize the GPHF model
gpf_model = gpf.model.GPF(dataset, groups)

# Train the model
model, like = gpf_model.train()

# Plot the losses
gpf_model.plot_losses()

# Generate predictions
preds, preds_scaled = gpf_model.predict(model=model, likelihood=like)

# Plot predictions vs. original data
gpf.visualization.plot_predictions_vs_original(
    dataset=dataset,
    prediction_mean=preds[0],
    prediction_std=preds[1],
    origin_data=gpf_model.original_data,
    inducing_points=gpf_model.inducing_points,
    x_original=np.array(groups["predict"]["x_values"])[: -groups["h"], np.newaxis],
    x_test=gpf_model.test_x.numpy(),
    n_series_to_plot=8,
    gp_type=gpf_model.gp_type,
)

# Calculate and store metrics
res = gpf_model.metrics(pred_mean=preds[0], pred_std=preds[1])
gpf_model.store_metrics(res)

```

## Experimental Results

We have conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of time series dependency alterations on Hierarchical Time Series forecasting models using the semi-synthetic datasets generated by RHiOTS. You can find an example image below that shows the RMSE percentage differences for each model, transformation, and version across multiple datasets.

The image displays the relationship between model performance and applied transformations. Rows correspond to transformations, while columns represent models. The x-axis shows different transformation parameter versions, and the y-axis presents the RMSE percentage differences compared to the original dataset.

These results highlight the influence of hierarchical structure on forecasting performance. The image visualizes data groups, colors, and confidence intervals, offering a high-level analysis that helps users assess the performance and robustness of various forecasting models when applied to time series data with varying dependency alterations.
