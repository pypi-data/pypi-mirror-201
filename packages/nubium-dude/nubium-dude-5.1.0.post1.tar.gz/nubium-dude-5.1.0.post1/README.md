# Installation and Setup

```
pipx install --python python3.8 nubium-dude
```

Other python versions will also work for installing dude, but python3.8 must be present for launching apps with dude because of the virtualenvs that dude manages. There is no option to change this virtualenv version yet.

## Configuration

As most CLI tools do, dude loads configuration in a hiearchial order:
1. defaults
2. config file
3. environment variables
4. command line options
5. environment variables that are sourced from `dotenv_files` key in the configuration
6. environment variables that are sourced from `./venv/local.env`

`tests/test_config.py` has examples of configuration files, here's one of them:
```
environments:
  default:
    clusters:
      default-A:
        bootstrap_urls: ["localhost", "kafka-1"]
  override:
    clusters:
      override-A:
        bootstrap_urls: ["localhost", "kafka-1"]
default_environment: default
```
The config file can be edited with `dude config edit`. This will launch a text
editor configured by either of the `VISUAL` or `EDITOR` environment variables.
The default path can be configured by setting `DUDE_CONFIG_FILE` with the full
path to an alternative yaml file.
If `DUDE_CONFIG_FILE` is not specified, an example default location 
(on Mac OS) is "/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/dude/config.yaml".


### Special tags
Any value can be dynamically computed frome these tags

#### !Environment
key's value would be `os.environ["VAR_NAME"]`
```
key: !Environment VAR_NAME
```

#### !DotEnv
key's value would be `dotenv_values("PATH")["VAR"]`
```
key: !DotEnv [PATH, VAR]
```
For more information on the dotenv syntax for the file pointed to by PATH, refer to see (dotenv's documentation)[https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv#file-format]

### Remnants of the previous configuration
```
HOSTNAME=""
RHOSAK_USERNAME=(nubium-secrets.rhosakUsername)
RHOSAK_PASSWORD=(nubium-secrets.rhosakPassword)
SCHEMA_REGISTRY_USERNAME=(nubium-secrets.rhosakUsername)
SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=(nubium-secrets.rhosakPassword)
SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL=(nubium-secrets.schemaRegistryUrl)
```
Example Openshift Secret: https://manage.preprod.iad2.dc.paas.redhat.com/console/project/mktg-ops--nubium-dev/browse/secrets/nubium-secrets

# Usage

`dude --help` or `dude subcommand --help`

## Managing Topics

### List topics

`dude topics list`

Topics will be listed by cluster.

### Create topics

`dude topics create --topics topic_a,topic_b`

If a topic is defined in the selected environment's configuration, then it will be created with the same configuration
defined in that file. Otherwise, the topic is created with a default configuration (note: `dude topics create --help`
will show the defaults).

### Create topics with custom partitions and replication factor

`dude topics create --topics topic_a --num-partitions 2 --replication-factor 2`

### Create topics on your `TEST_CLUSTER`, ignoring cluster maps in `cluster.py`

`dude topics create --topics topic_a,topic_b --ignore-cluster-maps`

### Delete topics

`dude topics delete --topics topic_a,topic_b`

## App

### Build requirements.txt

(in app root folder): `dude app build_reqs`

### Run app

(in app root folder): `dude app run`

### Run unit tests

(in app root folder): `dude app unit_test`

### Run integration test

(in app root folder): `dude app integration_test`

# Contributing
Run tests via:
```
pipx install tox
pipx inject tox tox-pyenv
tox
```

Pass extra arguments to pytest:
```
# run tests that have "translates" in their name
tox -e py38 -- -k translates
```

## Pipx isolated environments
If you want to run the `dude` script based on changes in your local repo, use
the editable option when installing with pipx:
```
pipx install -e /PATH/TO/DUDE/REPO
```

You can also inject editable versions of dependencies like this:
```
pipx inject nubium-dude -e /PATH/TO/nubium-utils
```
(Useful command for confirming whether you are using local repos for requirements: `pipx runpip nubium-dude freeze`)
