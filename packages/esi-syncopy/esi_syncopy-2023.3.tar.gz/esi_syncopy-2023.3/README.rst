Syncopy aims to be a user-friendly toolkit for *large-scale*
electrophysiology data-analysis in Python. We strive to achieve the following goals:

1. Syncopy is a *fully open source Python* environment for electrophysiology
   data analysis.
2. Syncopy is *scalable* and built for *very large datasets*. It automatically
   makes use of available computing resources and is developed with built-in
   parallelism in mind.
3. Syncopy is *compatible with FieldTrip*. Data and results can be loaded into
   MATLAB and Python, and parameter names and function call syntax are as similar as possible.

Syncopy is developed at the
`Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute (ESI) gGmbH for Neuroscience in Cooperation with Max Planck Society <https://www.esi-frankfurt.de/>`_
and released free of charge under the
`BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#3-clause_license_(%22BSD_License_2.0%22,_%22Revised_BSD_License%22,_%22New_BSD_License%22,_or_%22Modified_BSD_License%22)>`_.

Installation
============

We recommend to install SynCoPy into a new conda environment:

#. Install the `Anaconda Distribution for your Operating System <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ if you do not yet have it.
#. Start a new terminal.

   * You can do this by starting ```Anaconda navigator```, selecting ```Environments``` in the left tab, selecting the ```base (root)``` environment, and clicking the green play button and then ```Open Terminal```.
   * Alternatively, under Linux, you can just type ```bash``` in your active terminal to start a new session.

You should see a terminal with a command prompt that starts with ```(base)```, indicating that you are
in the conda ```base``` environment.

Now we create a new environment named ```syncopy``` and install syncopy into this environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -y --name syncopy
   conda activate syncopy
   conda install -y -c conda-forge esi-syncopy

Getting Started
===============
Please visit our `online documentation <http://syncopy.org>`_.
