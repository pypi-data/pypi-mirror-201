Aloha! Welcome to my pySports_Arbitrage project, created by yours truly, Phil Rongo

This package can work as a standalone data manipulation/machine learning library, or can extend the functionality of your
"TheOddsApi" subscription.

These are packaged modules to accomplish:

* Epic database infrastructure for sports arbitrage opportunities
  * Built specifically for postgresql databases
* Common data manipulation and visualization on your collected data [coming soon]
* Create ML models based on your data [coming soon]

docs soon...

Feel free to message me with ideas/comments

Phil
