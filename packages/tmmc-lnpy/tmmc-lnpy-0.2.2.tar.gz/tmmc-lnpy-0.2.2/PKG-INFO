# `tmmc-lnpy`

## Overview

A package to analyze $\ln \Pi(N)$ data from Transition Matrix Monte Carlo
simulation.  The main output from TMMC simulations, $\ln \Pi(N)$, provides a means to calculate a host of thermodynamic
properties.  Moreover, if $\ln \Pi(N)$ is calculated at a specific chemical potential, it can be reweighted to provide
thermodynamic information at a different chemical potential




## Features

``tmmc-lnpy`` provides a wide array of routines to analyze $\ln \Pi(N)$.  These include:

* Reweighting to arbitrary chemical potential
* Segmenting $\ln \Pi(N)$ (to identify unique phases)
* Containers for interacting with several values of $\ln \Pi(N)$ in a vectorized way.
* Calculating thermodynamic properties from these containers
* Calculating limits of stability, and phase equilibrium


## Status

This package is actively used by the author.  Please feel free to create a pull request for wanted features and suggestions!


## Quick start

Use one of the following

``` bash
pip install tmmc-lnpy
```

or

``` bash
conda install -c wpk-nist tmmc-lnpy
```

## Example usage

Note that the distribution name ``tmmc-lnpy`` is different than the import name ``lnpy`` due to name clashing on pypi.

``` python
import lnpy
import lnpy.examples

ref = lnpy.examples.load_example_maskddata('lj_sub')
```
