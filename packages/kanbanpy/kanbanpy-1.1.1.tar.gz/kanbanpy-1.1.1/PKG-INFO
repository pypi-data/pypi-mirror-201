# kanbanpy

A console-based Kanban task manager created in Python.

Create and manage tasks visually in your terminal using simple commands.

## Features

- Simple CLI commands
- ASCII based kanban board
- Easy setup
- Stores tasks in a readable format (JSON).

## Installation

Install using pip running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
pip install kanbanpy
```

## Configuration

kanbanpy requires a config file located in the user's home directory. This file
can be generated using the `setup` command:

```sh
# Run the setup wizard
kanbanpy setup

# Or use the defaults
kanbanpy setup -y
```

## Usage

If you installed the library, you can use the CLI as a system command:

```sh
kanbanpy [...args]
```

Or call it as a Python import:

```sh
python -m kanbanpy [...args]
```

### Examples

Here are some examples of the commands available:

```sh
# Just display the kanban board
kanbanpy

# Create a new task
kanbanpy create "A new todo"

# Move task with id 1 to the next status
kanbanpy next 1

# Revert a task with id 1 to the previous status
kanbanpy prev 1

# Remove task with id 1
kanbanpy remove 1
```

Commands also have convenient aliases:

- `create`: `c`
- `next`: `n`
- `prev`: `p`
- `remove`: `r`

To explore the full list of commands, run:

```sh
