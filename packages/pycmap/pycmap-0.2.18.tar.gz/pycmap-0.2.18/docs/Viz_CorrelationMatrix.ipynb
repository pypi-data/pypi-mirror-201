    "This function computes and plots the pair-correlation coefficient between the source and target variables. The results are visualized in form of a correlation matrix. To compute the correlations the source and target variables have to be colocalized first (see [Match (colocalize) Datasets](Match.ipynb)). The colocalization procedure relies on the tolerance parameters because they set the matching boundaries between the source and target datasets. Notice the source has to be a single non-climatological variable. In principle, if the source dataset is fully covered by the target variable's spatio-temporal range, there should always be matching results if the tolerance parameters are larger than half of their corresponding spatial/temporal resolutions. Please explore the [catalog](Catalog.ipynb) to find appropriate target  variables. Note that, currently, this visualization is only supported by plotly visualization library.\n",
