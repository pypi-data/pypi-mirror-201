    pymetrics API

    ### This is pymetrics's public API. The API can be used to get information on candidates as part of a job application workflow, or for employee career pathing and development. The typical use case for this is to support an externally initiated assessment for a candidate job application. This is often done \"inline\" with the candidate's application, or asynchronously after the candidate submits their application. This data can then be used for career pathing and employee development in subsequent stages.  The expected sequence of API calls is: * `Generate OAuth Token` with the OAuth Client ID and Secret you've been provided * `Get Assessment Configurations` to determine which configured assessment templates are available * `Create Assessment Order` for a selected Assessment and candidate job application * `Get Assessment Order` to receive the recommendation results and reports, once they are available  # noqa: E501
