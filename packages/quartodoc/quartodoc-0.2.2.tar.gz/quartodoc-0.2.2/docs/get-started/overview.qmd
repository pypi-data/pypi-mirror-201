::: {.callout-warning} 
quartodoc is work in progress!
:::

quartodoc let's you quickly generate python package documentation,
using markdown and [quarto](https://quarto.org).
It is designed as an alternative to Sphinx.

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install quartodoc

# or from github
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/machow/quartodoc.git
```

## Basic use

Getting started with quartodoc takes two steps: configuring a quarto website,
and generating documentation pages for your library.

First, create a `_quarto.yml` file with the following:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  resources:
    - objects.json

quartodoc:
  style: single-page
  dir: reference
  package: quartodoc
  sections:
    - title: Some functions
      desc: Functions to inspect docstrings.
      contents:
        - get_object
        - preview
```

Next, run this command to generate your API pages:

```bash
python -m quartodoc build
```

This should create a `reference/` directory with an `index.qmd` and documentation
pages for listed functions, like `get_object` and `preview`.

Finally, preview your website with quarto:

```bash
quarto preview
```

## Key Features

* Load docstrings (with [griffe](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe))
* Render docstrings (e.g. with [MdRenderer](/api/#sec-MdRenderer))
* Enable cross references to function documentation (with interlinks filter).
  - Link to functions within a doc.
  - Link to functions in other docs.
  - Generate an inventory file for other docs to link to yours.
* Generate high-level summaries (with [Builder](/api/#api-builders)).
  - First line of docstring used as description.
  - Class doc pages have table of class attributes.
  - Index pages list function names and descriptions.

## Example sites

| style | source | layout |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| [pkgdown] | [github][pkgdown-code] | Index page with a title and short description for functions listed in each section. Each function gets its own documentation page. |
| [single-page] | [github][sp-code] | Index page has function documentation embedded on it. |
