Summary: Tools for calculating NMR relaxation observables (R1/R2/NOE/T1/T2/Tau_c) directly from MD trajectories. Initially written for calculations regarding nucleosome simulations but can be extended for other proteins/complexes. version 0.0.5: 1.Updated with downloading testing MD traj on zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/7806382 and a new readme file for testing different MD traj. 2. Updated a new function allowing user to select residues with use_chain_id option in config.py file.
