# This README.md should briefly document what your module does or what functions is has

## An example discription

- This `amandalin047_package` is for analyzing regression-based event-related potentials (rERPs). The function `rerp_ols` returns the regression coefficients (with their corresponding t and p-values), fitted values, as well as the residuals.
- And of course, you'll have other folders and files than just this `README.md`, depending on how your module was packaged.
