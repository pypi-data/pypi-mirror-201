This is a module to aid in processing of liquid chromatography data.
It includes an easy interface to perform many operations required to process and analyse
chromatography data, such as: 0- Smoothing; 1- Baseline correction; 2- Search for peak and determine the width at a given relative height;
3- Detect fused peaks and determine the start and end of each of them; 4- Peak purity
