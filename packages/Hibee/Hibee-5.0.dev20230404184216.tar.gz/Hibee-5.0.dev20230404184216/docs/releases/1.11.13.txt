Hibee 1.11.13 release notes
============================

*May 1, 2018*

Hibee 1.11.13 fixes several bugs in 1.11.12.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Hibee 1.11.8 where altering a field with a unique
  constraint may drop and rebuild more foreign keys than necessary
  (:ticket:`29193`).

* Fixed crashes in ``hibee.contrib.admindocs`` when a view is a callable
  object, such as ``hibee.contrib.syndication.views.Feed`` (:ticket:`29296`).

* Fixed a regression in Hibee 1.11.12 where ``QuerySet.values()`` or
  ``values_list()`` after combining an annotated and unannotated queryset with
  ``union()``, ``difference()``, or ``intersection()`` crashed due to mismatching
  columns (:ticket:`29286`).
