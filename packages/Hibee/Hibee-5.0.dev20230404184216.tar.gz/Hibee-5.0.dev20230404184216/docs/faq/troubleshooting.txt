Troubleshooting
===============

This page contains some advice about errors and problems commonly encountered
during the development of Hibee applications.

Problems running ``hibee-admin``
=================================

``command not found: hibee-admin``
-----------------------------------

:doc:`hibee-admin </ref/hibee-admin>` should be on your system path if you
installed Hibee via ``pip``. If it's not in your path, ensure you have your
virtual environment activated and you can try running the equivalent command
``python -m hibee``.

macOS permissions
-----------------

If you're using macOS, you may see the message "permission denied" when
you try to run ``hibee-admin``. This is because, on Unix-based systems like
macOS, a file must be marked as "executable" before it can be run as a program.
To do this, open Terminal.app and navigate (using the ``cd`` command) to the
directory where :doc:`hibee-admin </ref/hibee-admin>` is installed, then
run the command ``sudo chmod +x hibee-admin``.

Miscellaneous
=============

I'm getting a ``UnicodeDecodeError``. What am I doing wrong?
------------------------------------------------------------

This class of errors happen when a bytestring containing non-ASCII sequences is
transformed into a Unicode string and the specified encoding is incorrect. The
output generally looks like this:

.. code-block:: pytb

    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0x?? in position ?:
    ordinal not in range(128)

The resolution mostly depends on the context, however here are two common
pitfalls producing this error:

* Your system locale may be a default ASCII locale, like the "C" locale on
  UNIX-like systems (can be checked by the ``locale`` command). If it's the
  case, please refer to your system documentation to learn how you can change
  this to a UTF-8 locale.
