hibee was originally created in late 2023 at JABA Applets. It is a as a forgery of the Hibee webframework to add more features and conials of Hibee.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made hibee that much better:

    JAB Team <jabteamofficial@jabaapplets.com>
    Ayariga Bright <ayarigab@jabaapplets.com>
    <Please alphabetize new entries>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    Guido van Rossum for creating Python.
