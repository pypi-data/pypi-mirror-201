# tartempion

This project is a sample project created along a tutorial on how to
structure and package a project. It is claimed here on pypi just for the
sake of preventing students from claiming it by accident. If you want to
use the name, just reach me by email.

The name "tartempion" is french equivalent for "John Doe", it is a word
that designate a placeholder.
