## Omnicloud World

Omnicloud World is a fleet of well-known software libraries which was been extended by cloud related methods.

Omnicloud now contains components inherited from [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [Dask](https://dask.org), [Odoo](https://odoo.com), etc & work with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).


## Value

Making software for a cloud requires two vectors business-logic & cloud integration codding.

Omnicloud components already contain cloud integration tools, so it gives developers opportunities to work with business-logic only.

<br/>

Prefer cases when omnicloud.dash will be an effective is making multiple containerised applications and
    deploying they in a cloud.

### Core

The core of omnicloud.dash is [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com).
Dash is the beautiful framework for Python, R, Julia builded top of React.js & Plotly.js. 

Thank to the React you can build a live, dynamic, modern web application with no knows about JavaScript. And thanks to Plotly your application can produced jaw-dropping visualisation.


### Nice UI

The class omnicloud.dash.Bootstrapped provides an integrated:

- Bootstrap
- Material icons & Awesome icons
- Google Fonts


### Speed & Security

An application builded with omnicloud.dash can be run on HTTP/2 web server out of box. This new version
    of protocol is binary & multiplexing so it is faster than the previous version. Additionally
    HTTP/2 always uses HTTPS.

### New technologies

Omnicloud is preparing to implement PyScript into Dash applications.
[PyScript](https://pyscript.net) is a technology for running python code in a web browser on
    the client side.
