Omnicloud World is a fleet of well-known software libraries which was been extended by cloud related methods.

Omnicloud now contains components inherited from [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [Dask](https://dask.org), [Odoo](https://odoo.com), etc & work with [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).


## Value

Making software for a cloud requires two vectors business-logic & cloud integration codding.

Omnicloud components already contain cloud integration tools, so it gives developers opportunities to work with business-logic only.

Prefer cases when omnicloud.dash will be an effective is making multiple containerised applications and
    deploying they in a cloud.

### Core

    HTTP/2 always uses HTTPS.

### New technologies
