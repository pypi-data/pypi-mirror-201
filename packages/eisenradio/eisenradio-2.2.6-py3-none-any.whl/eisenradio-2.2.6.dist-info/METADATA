Links
----
clone the latest version from GitHub dev branch, change to the folder ``pip install -e .``
 * Android: rename *WHL to *ZIP, extract with Android file manager
 * Android: https://pypi.org/project/eisenradio-apk/
 * Snap: https://snapcraft.io/eisenradio

Eisenradio - the boring details 
-------------------------------
 * REST API app on blueprints and ApplicationFactory of the Flask microframework with a SQLite database
 * First Internet Radio App that can run a Spectrum Analyser in a Web browser (Feb,2022)
 * A local Python Flask Web Server connects to the radio server in behalf of you. Your browser connects to Flask
   * Backend (server) opens the connection, buffers the radio stream and presents it to localhost IP: 127.0.0.1
   * Frontend (browser) controls the backend, plays internet and local audio playlists
   * Browser audio element connects `http://localhost:5050/sound/classic` that streams `http://37.251.146.169:8000/streamHD`
   * Closing the browser does not disconnect the server listen (buffer discarded) nor streaming connections
 * Plays and repairs aac plus files; play (1.3), repairs since version (1.4); 
 * Backup and restore are easy work with the help of an optional ex/imported human-readable *ini file
 * Blacklist feature for recorded files (titles); delete only once 
   * lists can be ex/imported via a json dictionary file to other devices
 * playing local audio uses the web server multiple file upload feature
 * Multithreading allows you an unlimited number of radio connections at the same time, until the ISP Bandwidth limit hits
 * Android APK Package uses Python Kivy for multi-touch and promotes the app to "foreground service" (to not get killed)

    $ ghettorecorder

You can export your ``settings.ini`` and ``blacklist.json`` 
via "Tools/Export/Names and URL's" menu from your database.
An updated ``blacklist.json`` can be imported into your database.

* Command line save path is in the package folder. You should change it via the menu options

     ``/home/osboxes/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ghettorecorder/radios``

pip install
