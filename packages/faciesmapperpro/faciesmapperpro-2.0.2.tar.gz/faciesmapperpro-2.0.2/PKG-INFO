Name: faciesmapperpro
Version: 2.0.2
Summary: FaciesMapperPro aims to automate the process of facies interpretation in borehole images using deep learning techniques.                     The system is designed to be integrated with Techlog; a software platform developed by SLB for enabling the integration                     of all wellbore-centric data types into multi-discipline workflows including geological data analysis.                    In 2.0.2 I added timer decorator to calculate the time taken by the predict function.
