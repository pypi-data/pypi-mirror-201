### **WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES**

Bomcheckgui is a graphical user interface (gui) for the bomcheck program.
It compares bills of materials (BOMs). Look at the bomcheck program
for more information.

### **HOW TO INSTALL**
Assuming that you already have Python on your machine, use the package
manager software [pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager))
that comes with Python:

`pip install bomcheckgui`

### **HOW TO RUN BOMCHECKGUI**

To open up the gui, from the command line, or via a link you set up, run:

`bomcheckgui`

### How it works

Drag and drop the BOM files that you want to be checked onto the central
portion of the gui.  Click the icon that looks like a green check mark to 
generate results.  An Excel file will be created and results stored to it.
