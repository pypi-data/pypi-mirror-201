pyFormex-3.3 Releasenotes
=========================
- NEW PyConsole, combining the message board and console in one, gives
  access to full pyFormex machinery, keeps history of entered commands,
  allows autocompletion, colored output, easy indent
- GUI improvements:
  -gui.draw.frontview: easily selects screen setup with y or z axis upwards
  -gui.draw.TempPalette allows temporary switching to nondefault palette
  -linking scenes in multiple viewports (illustrated in FourView example)
  -Camera locking can be done separately for direction and zooming
  -Camera.coordsys returns a CoordSys aligned along camera axes
- Image save allows saving a rectanglular area from the viewport
- NEW picking tool (operating with off-screen rendering) allows to pick
  only items in front of the rendering. The old picking tool (only seeing
  disconnected points) is also retained, but the new one is made the default.
  Picking functionality has been greatly improved and simplified and allow
  for easy continuous picking modes.
- New Pick and Query button menus in the toolbar allow faster access
- New LABELing functionality in tools.py: classes Label, Labels and functions
  lablePoints, labelPoints2D allow to interactively add/edit/remove labels
  to existing points or newly created points on a surface or a plane.
  mergedSurface creates a single merged surface from all current actors.
  These new tools even replace the query 2D functions.
- Tools menu has been completely revised and provides interactive configuring
  of the labeling/querying tools.
- nurbs.py: new interpolation curves and curve fitting functions,
  -cubicInterpolate: local interpolation strategy of degree 3.
  -quadraticInterpolate: local interpolation strategy of degree 3.
  -cubicSpline: traditional cubic spline with end tangents
  -globalInterpolationCurve: global interpolation strategy with or
   without tangents at all points or ends
  -lsqCurve fits an approximate curve to data points
  -optLsqCurve: fits an approximate curve to data points with required
   accuracy
  -NurbsCurve: can be called as a function and returns the point(s)
   at the provided parameter(s); projectPoint also returns the distance
   to the foot point; new projectPoints, distancePoints (convenience to
   project multiple points)
- Coords: new spiral transform to create spirals and helices, new dimensions
  method to get overall shape of the point cloud
- Mesh, Formex: report methods now work similar
- simple.py: grid1 creates a regular 1D grid of points
- arraytools.py: new quadraticEquation function returns both roots and type
- configurable defaults for precision in float array outputs
- pyformex command line: allow some Python interpreter options to be passed
- importing the lazy module is deprecated. The new core.py module
  is recommended to import everything.
- removed dependency on Python distutils
- AND a really long list of bug fixes and minpr improvements
