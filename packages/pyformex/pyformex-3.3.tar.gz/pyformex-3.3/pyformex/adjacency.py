    A class for storing and handling adjacency tables.

    An adjacency table defines a neighbouring relation between elements of
    a single collection. The nature of the relation is not important, but
    should be a binary relation: two elements are either related or they are
    not.

    Typical applications in pyFormex are the adjacency tables for storing
    elements connected by a node, or by an edge, or by a node but not by an
    edge, etcetera.

    Conceptually the adjacency table corresponds with a graph. In graph
    theory however the data are usually stored as a set of tuples `(a,b)`
    indicating a connection between the elements `a` and `b`.
    In pyFormex elements are numbered consecutively from 0 to nelems-1, where
    nelems is the number of elements. If the user wants another numbering,
    he can always keep an array with the actual numbers himself.
    Connections between elements are stored in an efficient two-dimensional
    array, holding a row for each element. This row contains the numbers
    of the connected elements.
    Because the number of connections can be different for each
    element, the rows are padded with an invalid elements number (-1).

    A normalized Adjacency is one where all rows do not contain duplicate
    nonnegative entries and are sorted in ascending order and where no column
    contains only -1 values.
    Also, since the adjacency is defined within a single collection, no row
    should contain a value higher than the maximum row index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: int :term:`array_like`
        Data to initialize the Connectivity. The data should be 2-dim with
        shape ``(nelems,ncon)``, where ``nelems`` is the number of elements and
        ``ncon`` is the maximum number of connections per element.
    dtyp: float datatype, optional
        Can be provided to force a specific int data type. If not, the
        datatype of ``data`` is used.
    copy: bool, optional
        If True, the data are copied. The default setting will try to use
        the original data if possible, e.g. if ``data`` is a correctly shaped
        and typed :class:`numpy.ndarray`.
    normalize: bool, optional
        If True (default) the Adjacency will be normalized at creation time.
    allow_self: bool, optional
        If True, connections of elements with itself are allowed. The default
        (False) will remove self-connections when the table is normalized.

    Warning
    -------
    The ``allow_self`` parameter is currently inactive.

        """Walks through the elements by their node front.

        A frontal walk is executed starting from the given element(s).
        A number of steps is executed, each step advancing the front
        over a given number of single pass increments. The step number at
        which an element is reached is recorded and returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        startat: int or list of ints
            Initial element number(s) in the front.
        frontinc: int
            Increment for the front number on each frontal step.
        partinc: int
            Increment for the front number when the front gets empty and
            a new part is started.
        maxval: int
            Maximum frontal value. If negative (default) the walk will
            continue until all elements have been reached. If non-negative,
            walking will stop as soon as the frontal value reaches this
            maximum.

        Returns
        -------
        int array
            An array of ints specifying for each element in which step
            the element was reached by the walker.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> A = Adjacency([
        ...       [-1,  1,  2,  3],
        ...       [-1,  0,  2,  3],

    def front(self, startat=0, add=False):
        """Returns the elements of the first node front.

        Parameters
        ----------
        startat: int or list od ints
            Element number(s) or a list of element numbers. The list of
            elements to find the next front for.
        add: bool, optional
            If True, the `startat` elements wil be included in the
            return value. The default (False) will only return the elements
            in the next front line.

        Returns
        -------
        int array
            A list of the elements that are connected to any of the nodes
            that are part of the startat elements.

        Notes
        -----
        This is equivalent to the first step of a :func:`frontWalk`
        with the same startat elements, and could thus also be obtained from
        ``where(self.frontWalk(startat,maxval=1) == 1)[0]``.

        Here however another implementation is used, which is more efficient
        for very large models: it avoids the creation of the large array as
        returned by frontWalk.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> a = Adjacency([[ 0,  0,  0,  1,  2,  5],
        ...                [-1,  0,  1, -1,  1,  3],
