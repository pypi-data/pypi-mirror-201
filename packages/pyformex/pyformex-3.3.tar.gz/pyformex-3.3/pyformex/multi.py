def splitArgs(args, mask=None, nproc=-1, close=False):
    """Split data blocks over multiple processors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args: list or tuple of :term:`array_like`
        A sequence of data blocks that may need to be split for parallel
        processing over multiple processors. Splitting is done along the
        first dimension, which should therefore be the same for all arrays
        in the sequence that need to be split.
    mask: list or tuple of bool
        If provided, this flags the items in ``args`` that should be split.
        The list should have the same length as ``args``.
        If not provided, all array type items in ``args`` will be split.
    nproc: int
        Intended number of processors. If negative (default), it is set equal
        to the number of processors detected on the host machine.
    close: bool
        If True, the elements where the arrays are split are included in both
        blocks delimited by the element. Thus splitting an array [1, 2, 3]
        in two results in [1, 2] and [2, 3], while the default split would
        be [1, 2] and [3].

    Returns
    -------
    list of tuples.
        The list contains ``nproc`` tuples and each tuple contains the same
        number of items as the input ``args`` and in the same order, whereby
        the (nonmasked) arrays are replaced by a slice of the array along
        its first axis, and the masked and non-array items are replicated
        as is.

    See Also
    --------
    arraytools.splitar: the low level function used to do the splitting

    Examples
    --------
    >>> splitArgs([np.arange(5),'abcde'],nproc=3)
    [(array([0, 1]), 'abcde'), (array([2]), 'abcde'), (array([3, 4]), 'abcde')]
    >>> for i in splitArgs([np.eye(5),'=>',np.arange(5)],nproc=3):
    ...     print("%s %s %s" % i)
    [[1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]] => [0 1]
    [[0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]] => [2]
    [[0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]] => [3 4]
    >>> for i in splitArgs([np.eye(5),'=>',np.arange(5)],mask=[1,0,0],nproc=3):
    ...     print("%s %s %s" % i)
    [[1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]] => [0 1 2 3 4]
    [[0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]] => [0 1 2 3 4]

    Returns
    -------

def multitask(tasks, nproc=-1, _async=True):
    """Perform tasks in parallel.

    Runs a number of tasks in parallel over a number of subprocesses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tasks: list of tuples
        Each task in the list is a tuple where the first item is a callable
        and the other items are the arguments to be passed to the callable.
    nproc: int
        The number of subprocesses to be started. This may be
        different from the number of tasks to run: processes finishing a
        task will pick up a next one. There is no benefit in starting more
        processes than the number of tasks or the number of processing units
        available. The default will set ``nproc`` to the minimum of these two
        values.
    _async: bool
        If True (default), the tasks are executed asynchronously and the
        results are collected when they are done. This has two benefits:

        - multitask can be run in 'script' execution mode,
        - the tasks can execute external commands (using :func:`process.run`,
          not :func:`utils.system` or :func:`utils.command`).

        If False, a small speedup may be obtained for tasks that do not
        need _async=True. But since the gain is marginal, this is not made
        the default. The use of this option is discouraged. It may be
        removed in future.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError:
        When using _async=False in script mode.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> task1 = (int.__add__, (2, 3))
    >>> task2 = (int.__mul__, (2, 3))
    >>> multitask((task1, task2))
    [5, 6]
    >>> from pyformex import process
    >>> tasks = [(process.run, ('ls -d .',)), (process.run, ('uname',))]
    >>> for res in multitask(tasks, _async=True): print(res.stdout)
