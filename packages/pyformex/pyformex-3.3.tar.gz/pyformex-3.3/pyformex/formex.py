"""Formex algebra in Python

This module defines the :class:`Formex` class, which is one of the two
major classes for representing geometry in pyFormex (the other one being
:class:`~mesh.Mesh`). The Formex class represents geometry as a simple
3-dim :class`~coords.Coords` array.
This allows an implementation of most functionality
of Formex algebra with a consistent and easy to use syntax.

@utils.pzf_register
class Formex(Geometry):
    """A structured collection of points in 3D space.

    A Formex is a collection of points in a 3D cartesian space.
    The collection is structured into a set of elements all having the
    same number of points (e.g. a collection triangles all having three
    points).

    As the Formex class is derived from :class:`~geometry.Geometry`,
    a Formex object has a :attr:`coords` attribute which is a
    :class:`~coords.Coords` object. In a Formex this is always an
    array with 3 axes (numbered 0,1,2).
    Each scalar element of this array represents a coordinate.
    A row along the last axis (2) is a set of 3 coordinates and represents
    a point (aka. node, vertex).

    For simplicity's sake, the current implementation only deals with points
    in a 3-dimensional space. This means that the length of axis 2 always
    equals 3.
    The user can create Formices (plural of Formex) in a 2-D space, but
    internally these will be stored with 3 coordinates, by adding a third
    value 0. All operations work with 3-D coordinate sets. However, it is
    easy to extract only a limited set of coordinates from the results,
    permitting to return to a 2-D environment

    A plane of the array along the axes 2 and 1 is a set of points:
    we call this an element.
    This can be thought of as a geometrical shape (2 points form a line segment,
    3 points make a triangle, ...) or as an element in Finite Element terms.
    But it really is up to the user as to how this set of points is to be
    interpreted. He can set an element type on the Formex to make this clear
    (see below).

    The whole Formex then represents a collection of such elements.
    The Formex concept and layout is made more clear in
    :ref:`sec:formex` in the :doc:`../tutorial`.

    Additionally, a Formex may have a property set, which is an 1-D array of
    integers. The length of the array is equal to the length of axis 0 of the
    Formex data (i.e. the number of elements in the Formex). Thus, a single
    integer value may be attributed to each element. It is up to the user to
    define the use of this integer (e.g. it could be an index in a table of
    element property records).
    If a property set is defined, it will be copied together with the Formex
    data whenever copies of the Formex (or parts thereof) are made.
    Properties can be specified at creation time, and they can be set,
    modified or deleted at any time. Of course, the properties that are
    copied in an operation are those that exist at the time of performing
    the operation.

    Finally, a Formex object can have an element type, because plexitude
    alone does not uniquely define what the geometric entities are, and how
    they should be rendered. By default, pyFormex will render plex-1 as
    points, plex-2 as line segments, plex-3 as triangles and any higher
    plexitude as polygons. But the user could e.g. set
    ``eltype = 'tet4'`` on a plex-4 Formex, and then that would be rendered
    as tetraeders.


    Parameters
    ----------
    data: Formex, Coords, :term:`array_like` or string
        Data to initialize the coordinates attribute ``coords`` in the Formex.
        See more details below.
    prop: int :term:`array_like`, optional
        1-dim int array with non-negative element property numbers.
        If provided, :meth:`setProp` will be called to assign the
        specified properties.
    eltype: str | :class:`~elements.ElementType`, optional
        The element type of the geometric entities (elements).
        If provided, it should be an :class:`~elements.ElementType`
        instance or the name of such an instance.
        If not provided, the pyFormex default is used when needed and is
        based on the plexitude: 1 = point, 2 = line segment,
        3 = triangle, 4 or more is a polygon.


    The Formex coordinate data can be initialized by another :class:`Formex`,
    by a :class:`Coords`, by a 1D, 2D or 3D :term:`array_like`, or by a string
    that will be passed to :func:`coords.fpattern` to generate the
    coordinates.
    If 2D coordinates are given, a 3-rd coordinate 0.0 is added.
    Internally, Formices always work with 3D coordinates.
    Thus::

      F = Formex([[[1,0],[0,1]],[[0,1],[1,2]]])

    creates a Formex with two elements, each having 2 points in the global
    z-plane. The innermost level of brackets group the coordinates of a
    point, the next level groups the points in an element, and the outermost
    brackets group all the elements of the Formex.
    Because the coordinates are stored in an array with 3 axes,
    all the elements in a Formex must contain the same number of points.
    This number is called the plexitude of the Formex.

    A Formex may be initialized with a string instead of the numerical
    coordinate data. The string is passed to :func:`coords.fpattern` to
    generate the coordinates.
    The following are two equivalent definitions of (the circumference of)
    a triangle::

      F = Formex('2:010207')
      G = Formex('l:127')

    Because the :class:`Formex` class is derived from
    :class:`~geometry.Geometry`, it has the following attributes:

    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.coords`,
    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.prop`,
    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.attrib`,
    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.fields`.

    Furthermore it has the following properties and methods that are applied
    on the :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.coords` attribute.

    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.xyz`,
    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.x`,
    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.y`,
    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.z`,
    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.xy`,
    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.yz`,
    - :attr:`~geometry.Geometry.xz`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.points`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.bbox`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.center`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.bboxPoint`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.centroid`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.sizes`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.dsize`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.bsphere`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.bboxes`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.inertia`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.principalCS`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.principalSizes`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.distanceFromPlane`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.distanceFromLine`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.distanceFromPoint`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.directionalSize`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.directionalWidth`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.directionalExtremes`.

    Also, the following Coords transformation methods can be
    directly applied to a :class:`Formex` object.
    The return value is a new Formex identical to the original,
    except for the coordinates,
    which are transformed by the specified method.
    Refer to the corresponding :class:`~coords.Coords` method
    for the usage of these methods:

    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.scale`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.adjust`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.translate`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.centered`,

    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.affine`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.toCS`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.fromCS`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.transformCS`,

    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.spherical`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.superSpherical`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.toSpherical`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.bump`,

    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.map`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.map1`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.mapd`,

    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.projectOnPlane`,
    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.projectOnSphere`,

    - :meth:`~geometry.Geometry.isopar`,

        If all Formices are without properties, so will be the result.
        The eltype of the resulting Formex will be that of the first Formex in
        the list.

        ----------
        Flist: list of Formex objects
            A list of Formices all having the same plexitude.

        Returns
        -------
        Formex
            The concatenation of all the Formices in the list. The number of
            elements in the Formex is the sum of the number of elements in
            all the Formices.

        """Flag elements having coordinates between min and max.

        This is comparable with :meth:`coords.Coords.test` but operates
        at the Formex element level. It tests the position of one or more
        points of the elements of the :class:`Formex` with respect to
        one or two parallel planes. This is very useful in clipping
        a Formex in a specified direction. In most cases the clipping
        direction is one of the global coordinate axes, but a general
        direction may be used as well.

        Testing along global axis directions is highly efficient. It tests
        whether the corresponding coordinate is above or equal to the `min`
        value and/or below or equal to the `max` value. Testing in a general
        direction tests whether the distance to the `min` plane is positive
        or zero and/or the distance to the `max` plane is negative or zero.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nodes: int, list of ints or string
            Specifies which points of the elements are taken into account
            in the tests. It should be one of the following:

            - a single point index (smaller than self.nplex()),
            - a list of point numbers ( all smaller than < self.nplex()),
            - one of the special strings: 'all', 'any', 'none'.

            The default ('all') will flag the elements that have all their
            nodes between the planes x=min and x=max, i.e. the elements that
            fall completely between these planes.
        dir: a single int or a float :term:`array_like` (3,)
            The direction in which to measure distances. If an int, it is
            one of the global axes (0,1,2). Else it is a vector with 3
            components. The default direction is the global x-axis.
        min: float or point-like, optional
            Position of the minimal clipping plane.
            If `dir` is an int, this is a single float giving the coordinate
            along the specified global axis. If `dir` is a vector, this must
            be a point and the minimal clipping plane is defined by this point
            and the normal vector `dir`. If not provided, there is no clipping
            at the minimal side.
        max: float or point-like.
            Position of the maximal clipping plane.
            If `dir` is an int, this is a single float giving the coordinate
            along the specified global axis. If `dir` is a vector, this must
            be a point and the maximal clipping plane is defined by this point
            and the normal vector `dir`. If not provided, there is no clipping
            at the maximal side.
        atol: float
            Tolerance value added to the tests to account for accuracy
            and rounding errors.
            A `min` test will be ok if the point's distance from the
            `min` clipping plane is `> -atol` and/or the distance from the
            `max` clipping plane is `< atol`. Thus a positive atol widens the
            clipping planes.

        Returns
        -------
        : 1-dim bool array
            Array with length ``self.nelems()`` flagging the elements that
            pass the test(s). The return value can directly be used as an
            index in :meth:`select` or `cselect` to obtain a :class:`Formex`
            with the elements satisfying the test or not. Or you can use
            ``np.where(result)[0]`` to get the indices of the elements passing
            the test.

        Raises
        ------

        div: int or list of floats
            The list of parameter values at which to subdivide the elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Flist: list of Formices
        The Formices to connect. The number of Formices in the list will

        If provided, the list should have the same length as ``Flist``.
        The default is to use the first point of each element.
    bias: list of int, optional

    Formex
        A Formex with plexitude equal to ``len(Flist)``.
        Each element of the Formex consists of a point from the corresponding

        Corresponding elements in the Formices are by default those with the

        to start the element indexing for each of the input Formices.

        If loop is False (default), the number of elements is the minimum
        over all Formices of the number of elements minus the corresponding
        bias. If loop is True, the number of elements is the maximum of the
        number of elements of all input Formices.
