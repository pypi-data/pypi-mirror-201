    All points generated by this function lie on a circle with unit radius at

      segment (dash angle).
    - `a2`: the angle enclosed between the start points of two subsequent line
      segments (module angle). If ``a2==0.0``, `a2` will be taken equal to `a1`.
    - `a3`: the total angle enclosed between the first point of the first
      segment and the end point of the last segment (arc angle).

    All angles are given in degrees and are measured in the direction from
    x- to y-axis. The first point of the first segment is always on the x-axis.

    The default values produce a full circle (approximately).
    If $a3 < 360$, the result is an arc.
    Large values of `a1` and `a2` result in polygons. Thus
    `circle(120.)` is an equilateral triangle and `circle(60.)`
    is regular hexagon.

    Remark that the default a2 == a1 produces a continuous line,
    while a2 > a1 results in a dashed line.

    Three optional arguments can be added to scale and position the circle
    in 3D space:

    - `r`: the radius of the circle
    - `n`: the normal on the plane of the circle

    Parameters
    ----------
    ndiv: int
        Number of divisions along the edges of the base surface. The higher

          quality with triangles of almost same size and shape.

    radius: float, optional
        The radius of the sphere. Default is 1.0.
    equiv: 'R' | 'A' | 'V'
        The quantity that should be equivalent with the perfect sphere.
        The default ('R') places the points exactly at the specified radius.
        The computed area and volume will obviously be less than
        those of the perfect sphere. With 'A' or 'V', the radius is
