"""pyFormex GUI module initialization.

This module is intended to form a single access point to the Python
wrappers for the QT libraries, which form the base of the pyFormex GUI.
By using a single access point, we can better deal with API changes
in the wrappers.

All pyFormex modules accessing QT libraries should do this by importing
from this module.

This module also detects the underlying windowing system.
Currently, the pyFormex GUI is only guaranteed on X11.
For other systems, a warning will be printed that some things may not work.
