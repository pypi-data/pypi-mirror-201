"""2D drawing menu

This pyFormex plugin menu provides some interactive 2D drawing functions.
While the drawing operations themselves are in 2D, they can be performed
on a plane with any orientation in space. The constructed geometry always
has 3D coordinates in the global cartesian coordinate system.
