"""Local http server and html file viewer

This module provides functionality to view a local html file in the
browser using the 'http:' transport mechanism instead of 'file:'.
It was created to allow viewing WebGL models from a local directory.

class HttpServer:
    """A specialized http server to serve local files.

    This server is intended to serve local files to a browser.
    It is meant as a replacement for the 'file:' transport mechanism.
    For security reasons modern browsers often do not allow to include
    files (especially script types) from another origin. With the file:
    protocol any other file, even in the same directory, may be considered
    as a foreign origin. A CORS error is raised in such cases.

    The solution is to use a local http server and access the files over
    'http:' protocol. The HttpServer is very lightweight class which can
    serve a directory and all its files and subdirectories to the local
    machine. It is not intended to be exposed directly to the network.
    It uses the :class:`http.server` from the Python standard library.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path: :term:`path_like`
        The path of the local directory to be served. The user should have
        read access to this directory.
    port: int | None
        The TCP port on which the server will be listening. This should be
        an unused port number in the high rang (>= 1024). If not provided,
        a random free port number will be used.


    Every successfully created HttpServer is registered by adding it to the
    list HttpServer._servers. When pyFormex exits, all these servers will be
    topped. The user can stop a server at any time though. If you want a
    server to continue after pyFormex exits, remove it from the list. The
    following attributes of the HttpServer provide useful information:

    path: :class:`Path`
        The path of the directory with accessible files.
    port: int:
        The port number on which the server is listening.
        In your browser, use ``http://localhost:PORT/SOMEFILE`` to
        view the contents of SOMEFILE.
    P: :class:`subprocess.Popen`
        The Popen instance of the running server.
        Its attribute P.pid gives the process id of the server.
