    """Perform boolean/intersection methods on TriSurfaces.

    Boolean operations between two surfaces are a basic operation in
    free surface modeling. Both surfaces should be closed orientable
    non-intersecting manifolds. This means they represent an enclosed
    volume. :meth:`TriSurface.check` can be used to find out if the
    surface is ok.

    The boolean operations are set operations on the enclosed volumes:
    union('+'), difference('-') or intersection('*').

    This uses the external program ``gtsset`` to do the actual computation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    surf1: TriSurface
        The first TriSurface (should be a closed orientable
        non-intersecting manifold).
    surf2: TriSurface
        The second TriSurface (should be a closed orientable
        non-intersecting manifold).
    op: '+', '-', '*' or 'a'
        The boolean operation to perform: union('+'), difference('-')
        or intersection('*'), or 'a' to compute all parts of the intersection,
        allowing to compose different results.
    filt: str
        A filter command to be executed on the gtsset output. The string
        should start with a '|', and the filter will be run as a pipe
        on the gtsset output and should produce the filtered output on
        stdout.
    ext: str
        The extension to be added on the ``result`` file.
    curve: bool
        If True, an intersection curve is computed, else a new surface.

    Returns
    -------
    TriSurface | dict | Mesh | None:

        - if curve is False and op is one of '+', '-' or '\*': the resulting
          TriSurface;
        - if curve is False and op is 'a': a dict with four keys, each having
          a TriSurface as value:

          - 's1in2': the part of surf1 that is inside surf2,
          - 's1out2': the part of surf1 that is outside surf2,
          - 's2in1': the part of surf2 that is inside surf1,
          - 's2out1': the part of surf2 that is outside surf1;

        - if curve is True: a Mesh of eltype Line2, containing the intersection
          curve(s);
        - if surf1 and surf2 do not intersect: None.

    The prefered way to invoke this function is by usint the :class:`TriSurface`
