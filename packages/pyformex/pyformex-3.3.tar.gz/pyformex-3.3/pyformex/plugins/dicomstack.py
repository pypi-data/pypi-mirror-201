"""Convert bitmap images into numpy arrays.

This module contains functions to convert bitmap images into numpy
arrays and vice versa. There are functions to read image from file
into arrays, and to save image arrays to files. There is even a class
that reads a full stack of Dicom images into a 3D numpy array.

Some of this code was based on ideas found on the PyQwt mailing list.
"""

import numpy as np


class DicomStack():
    """
    A stack of DICOM images.

    Note
    ----
    This class is only available if you have pydicom installed.


    The DicomStack class stores a collection of DICOM images
    and provides conversion to ndarray.

    The DicomStack is initialized by a list of file names.
    All input files are scanned for DICOM image data and
    non-DICOM files are skipped.
    From the DICOM files, the pixel and slice spacing are read,
    as well as the origin.
    The DICOM files are sorted in order of ascending origin_z value.

    While reading the DICOM files, the following attributes are set:

    - `files`: a list of the valid DICOM files, in order of ascending
      z-value.
    - `pixel_spacing`: a dict with an (x,y) pixel spacing tuple as key
      and a list of indices of the matching images as value.
    - `slice_thickness`: a list of the slice thicknesses of the
      images, in the same order as `files`.
    - `xy_origin`: a dict with an (x,y) position the pixel (0,0) as key
      and a list of indices of the matching images as value.
    - `z_origin`: a list of the z positions of the images,
      in the same order as `files`.
    - `rejected`: list of rejected files.
