"""Predefined geometries for a special purpose.

This module contains some predefined special purpose geometries functions.
You need to import this module in your scripts/apps to have access to its
contents.

Contents
--------

    A geometrical representation of a coordinate system.

class Axes(List):

    """A geometry representing the three axes of a coordinate system.

    This class is a subclass of :class:`List` and contains two :class:`Mesh`
    instances: the lines along the axes and the triangles in the coordinate
    planes.

    The default geometry consists of three colored lines of unit length
    along the positive directions of the axes of the coordinate system,
    and three colored triangles representing the coordinate planes.
    The triangles extend from the origin to half the length of the
    unit vectors. Default colors for the axes is red, green, blue.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cs: :class:`coordsys.CoordSys`
        If provided, the Axes will represent the specified CoordSys. Else,
        The axes are aligned along the global axes.
    size: float
        A scale factor for the unit vectors.
    psize: float
        Relative scale factor for the coordinate plane triangles.
        If 0, no triangles will be drawn.
    reverse: bool
        If True, also the negative unit axes are included, with
        colors 4..6.
    color: 3 or 6 colors
        A set of three or six colors to use for x,y,z axes.
        If `reverse` is True or psize > 0.0, the color set should have 6 colors,
        else 3 will suffice.
    **kargs: keyword arguments
        Any extra keyword arguments will be added as attributes
        to the geometry.
