"""A general yet simple configuration class.

| (C) 2005, 2021 Benedict Verhegghe
| Distributed under the GNU GPL version 3 or later

Why
   I wrote this simple class because I wanted to use Python
   expressions in my configuration files. This is so much more fun
   than using .INI style config files.  While there are some other
   Python config modules available on the web, I couldn't find one
   that suited my needs and my taste: either they are intended for
   more complex configuration needs than mine, or they do not work
   with the simple Python syntax I expected.

What
   Our Config class is just a normal Python dictionary which can hold
   anything.  Fields can be accessed either as dictionary lookup
   (config['foo']) or as object attributes (config.foo).  The class
   provides a function for reading the dictionary from a flat text
   (multiline string or file). I will always use the word 'file'
   hereafter, because that is what you usually will read the
   configuration from.  Your configuration file can have named
   sections. Sections are stored as other Python dicts inside the top
   Config dictionary. The current version is limited to one level of
   sectioning.

def formatDict(d):

    Each (key,value) pair is formatted on a line of the form::

    If all the keys are strings containing only characters that are
    allowed in Python variable names, the resulting text is a legal
    Python script to define the items in the dict. It can be stored
    on a file and executed.

    This format is the storage format of the Config class.

    Examples

    >>> print(formatDict({'str':'abc', 'path':Path(), 'int':4}))
    str = 'abc'
    path = Path('.')

class Config(Dict):
    """A configuration class allowing Python expressions in the input.

    The Config class is a subclass of the :class:`Dict` mapping, which
    provides access to items by either dict-style key lookup
    ``config['foo']``, attribute syntax ``config.foo`` or call syntax
    ``config('foo')``. Furthermore, the Dict class allows a default_factory
    function to lookup in another Dict. This allows a chain of Config
    objects: session_prefs -> user_prefs -> factory_defaults.

    The Config class is different from its parent Dict class in two ways:

    - Keys should only be strings that are valid Python variable names,
      except that they can also contain a '/' character.
      The '/' splits up the key in two parts: the first part becomes a
      key in the Config, and its value is a :class:`Section` dict where
      the values are stored with the second part of the key.
      This allows for creating sections in the configuration. Currently
      only one level of sectioning is allowed (keys can only have a single
      '/' character.

    - A Config instance can be initialized or updated with a text in
      Python source style. This provides an easy way to store
      configurations in files with Python style. The Config class also
      provides a way to export its contents to such a Python source text:
      updated configurations can thus be written back to a configuration
      file. See Notes below for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: dict or multiline string, optional
        Data to initialize the Config. If a dict, all keys should follow
        the rules for valid config keys formulated above.
        If a multiline string, it should be an executable Python source
        text, with the limitations and exceptions outlined in the Notes
        below.
    default: :class:`Config` object, optional
        If provided, this object will be used as default lookup for
        missing keys.

    Notes
    -----
    The configuration object can be initialized from a dict or from
    a multiline string. Using a dict is obvious: one only has to obey
    the restriction that keys should be valid Python variable names.

    The format of the multiline config text is described hereafter.
    This is also the format in which config files are written and
    can be loaded.

    All config lines should have the format: key = value, where key is a
    string and value is a Python expression The first '=' character on the
    line is the delimiter between key and value.  Blanks around both the
    key and the value are stripped.  The value is then evaluated as a
    Python expression and stored in a variable with name specified by the
    key. This variable is available for use in subsequent configuration
    lines. It is an error to use a variable before it is defined.  The
    key,value pair is also stored in the Config dictionary, unless the key
    starts with an underscore ('_'): this provides for local variables.

    Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored, as are empty
    and blank lines.  Lines ending with '\' are continued on the next
    line.  A line starting with '[' starts a new section. A section is
    nothing more than a Python dictionary inside the Config
    dictionary. The section name is delimited by '['and ']'. All
    subsequent lines will be stored in the section dictionary instead
    of the toplevel dictionary.

    All other lines are executed as Python statements. This allows
    e.g. for importing modules.

    Whole dictionaries can be inserted at once in the Config with the
    update() function.

    All defined variables while reading config files remain available
    for use in the config file statements, even over multiple calls to
    the read() function. Variables inserted with addSection() will not
    be available as individual variables though, but can be accessed as
    ``self['name']``.

    As far as the resulting Config contents is concerned, the following are
    equivalent::

       C.update({'key':'value'})
       C.read("key='value'\\n")

    There is an important difference though: the second line will make a
    variable key (with value 'value') available in subsequent Config read()
    method calls.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> C = Config('''# A simple config example
    ...     aa = 'bb'
    ...     bb = aa
    ...     [cc]
    ...     aa = 'aa'    # yes ! comments are allowed)
    ...     _n = 3       # local: will get stripped
    ...     rng = list(range(_n))
    ...     ''')
    >>> C
    Config({'aa': 'bb', 'bb': 'bb', 'cc': Section({'aa': 'aa', 'rng': [0, 1, 2]})})
    >>> C['aa']
    'bb'
    >>> C['cc']
    Section({'aa': 'aa', 'rng': [0, 1, 2]})
    >>> C['cc/aa']
    'aa'
    >>> C.keys()
    ['aa', 'bb', 'cc', 'cc/aa', 'cc/rng']

    Create a new Config with default lookup in C

    >>> D = Config(default=C)
    >>> D
    Config({})
    >>> D['aa']       # Get from C
    'bb'
    >>> D['cc']       # Get from C
    Section({'aa': 'aa', 'rng': [0, 1, 2]})
    >>> D['cc/aa']            # Get from C
    'aa'
    >>> D.get('cc/aa','zorro')      # but get method does not cascade!
    'zorro'
    >>> D.keys()
    []

    Setting values in D will store them in D while C remains unchanged.

    >>> D['aa'] = 'wel'
    >>> D['dd'] = 'hoe'
    >>> D['cc/aa'] = 'ziedewel'
