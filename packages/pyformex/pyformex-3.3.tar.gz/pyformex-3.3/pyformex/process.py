"""Executing external commands.

This module provides some functions for executing external commands in
a subprocess. They are based on the standard Python :mod:`subprocess`
module, but provide some practical enhancements.

Contents:

- :class:`DoneProcess` is a class to hold information about a terminated
  process.
- :func:`run` runs a command in a subprocess and waits for it to finish.
  Returns a :class:`DoneProcess` about the outcome.
- :func:`start` starts a subprocess and does not wait for it.
  Returns a :class:`subprocess.Popen` instance that can be used to communicate
  with the process.

This module can be used independently from pyFormex.

    Attributes
    ----------
    args: str or sequence of arguments

    returncode: int
        The exit code of the subprocess. Typical a 0 means it ran
        succesfully. If the subprocess fails to start, the value
        is 127. Other non-zero values can be returned by the child
        process to flag some error condition.
    stdout: str or bytes or None
        The standard output captured from the child process.
    stderr: str or bytes or None
        The error output captured from the child process.
    failed: bool
        True if the child process failed to start, e.g. due to a
        non-existing or non-loadable executable. The returncode
        will be 127 in this case.

    """Execute a command through the operating system.

    Run an external command in a subprocess, waiting for its termination
    or not. This is similar to Python3's :func:`subprocess.run`, but
    provides the following enhancements:

    - If `shell` is True, and no `executable` is provided, the shell
      will default to the value in the user's SHELL environment variable,
      and if that isn't set, to '/bin/sh'.

    - If a string is passed as `args` and `shell` is False, the string is
      automatically tokenized into an args list.

    - If no stdout nor stderr are specified, the output of the command
      is captured by default.

    - The `encoding` is set to 'utf-8' by default, so that stdout
      and stderr are returned as strings.

    - stdin, stdout and stderr can be file names. They will be replaced
      with the opened files (in mode 'r' for stdin, 'w' for the others).

    - Exceptions are captured by default and can be detected from
      the return value.

    - A `wait` parameter allows the same function to be used to just
      start a subprocess and not wait for its outcome.

    Only the new and changed parameters are described hereafter. Except for
    the first (`args`), all parameters should be specified by keyword.
    For more parameters, see :class:`subprocess.run`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args: str or list of str.
        If a string is provided, it is the command as it should be entered
        in a shell. If it is a list, args[0] is the executable to run
        and the remainder of args are the arguments to be passed to it.

        If a string is provided and `shell` is False (default), the string is
        split into an args list using :func:`shlex.split`.
    capture_output: bool
        If True (default), both stdout and stderr are captured and available
        from the returned :class:`DoneProcess`. Specifying a value for any of
        `stdout` or `stderr` values will however override the capture_output
        setting.
    shell: bool
        Default is False. If True, the command will be run in a new shell.
        The `args` argument should be a string in this case.
        Note that this uses more resources, may cause a problem in killing the
        subprocess and and may pose a security risk.
        Unless you need some shell functionality (like parameter expansion,
        compound commands, pipes), the advised way to execute a command is
        to use the default False.
    executable: str
        The full path name of the program to be executed.
        This can be used to specify the real executable if the
        program specified in `args` is not in your PATH, or,
        when `shell` is True, if you want to use a shell other than
        the default: the value of the 'SHELL' environment variable,
        and if that is not set, '/bin/sh/'.
    encoding: str
        The encoding for the returned stdout and stderr. The default is
        'utf-8', making the returned values Python3 str types. Specifying
        encoding=None will return bytes. Another encoding may be specified
        if needed.
    input: str
        If provided, passes the provided string as stdin to the started
        process. Only available with wait=True.
    timeout: int
        If provided, this is the maximum number of seconds the process is
        allowed to run. After this time the Process will be killed.
    check: bool
        Default is False.
        If True, an exception will be raised when the command did not
        terminate normally: a non-zero returncode, a timeout condition
        or a failure to start the executable. With the default, these
        conditions are captured and reported in the return value.
    **kargs: keyword arguments
        Any other keyword arguments accepted by :class:`subprocess.Popen`.
        See the Python documentation for :class:`subprocess.Popen` for full info.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`DoneProcess` | :class:`subprocess.Popen`
        If ``wait`` is True (default), returns a :class:`DoneProcess`
        collecting all relevant info about the finished subprocess.
        See :class:`DoneProcess` for details.

        If ``wait`` is False, returns the created :class:`subprocess.Popen`.
        In this case the user if fully responsible for handling the
        communication with the process, its termination, and the processing
        of its outcome.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> P = run("pwd")
    >>> P.stdout.strip('\\n') == os.getcwd()
    True

    >>> P = run("pwd", stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> P.stdout.strip('\\n') == os.getcwd()
    True

    >>> P = run("echo 'This is stderr' > /dev/stderr", shell=True)
