"""Texture

This example demonstrates the possibilities of drawing with a 2D texture.

It prompts the user to select an image file, and then draws the selected
as a texture on a set of squares in each of the colors of the default
colormap, and in each of the supported texture modes. The number next to
the 'G' character in the rendering represents the mode.
The blending of G3 can be interactively adjusted using the ObjectDialog.

Draw with texture
.................
Drawing a 2D texture on a Mesh of quad4 elements is as easy as::

   draw(M,texture=image)

where image is a numpy array with rgba values. The image will be added
on each element. By default the image will be modulated with the object
color. You should add color=white to view the image unaltered.

Texture mode
............
The blending of the texture image with the object color can be done in
different ways, selectable by adding an argument `texmode`:

- `texmode = 0`: the image colors replace the object color. Because texture
  is added after the lighting has been computed, object lighting will be
  destroyed in this mode.
- `texmode = 1`: the image colors are modulated with the object's color. This
  is the default mode. Use a white object color to get the original image
  colors.
- `texmode = 2`: this mode is prefered when the texture has transparency.
  The result is a mix of object and image colors, with a weight depending
  on the image's alpha channel. If the image has no alpha channel, this
  produces the same result as mode 0.
- `texmode = 3`: this mode produces a mix of object and image colors, weighed
  by the object's alpha value. The result is as if the object is a colored
  glass, and the image is behind it.

Limitations
...........
Currently there can only be one texture in a scene.
