"""Horseslice

This example illustrates working with triangulated surfaces in pyFormex.
A triangulated surface (TriSurface) is read from the file 'horse.off'
in the pyformex data directory. The surface is drawn.

Next the surface is intersected with a series of parallel plan. A dialog
dialog pops up where the user can set the parameters to define this planes.
Finally, the intersection curves are drawn on the surface. The 'ontop' option
will draw the curves fully visible (like if the surface were transparent).
The 'remove surface' option removes the surface, leaving only the curves.
