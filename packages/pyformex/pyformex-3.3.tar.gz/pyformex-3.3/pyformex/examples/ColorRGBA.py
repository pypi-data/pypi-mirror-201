These two colored squares were drawn with RGBA color mode. The RGB
components are the same for both squares. The squares hide a black
rectangle.

For the left square only RGB components were given, without A value:
the default 0.5 is then used for all points, making the transparency
uniform over the square.
For the right square the value of A was set to 0.0 at the left corners
and to 1.0 at the right corners, making the transparency
range horizontally over the square from fully transparent to opaque.

To see the effect, click the 'Toggle Transparent Mode' button.
