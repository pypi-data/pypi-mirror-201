"""Circulize

This example illustrates the 'circulize' transformation.

This creates a triangular sector from a regular n-sided polygon and
subdivides it with m parts along each edge. The sector is then
transformex into a circular sector. The circular sector is finally
rotationally repeated to create a full circle.
