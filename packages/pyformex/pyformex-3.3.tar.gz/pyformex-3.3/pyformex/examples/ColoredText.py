"""ColoredText

This example illustrates the drawing of text on the 2D OpenGL canvas.
It also shows how to generate random values and how to remove 2D decorations
from the canvas.

The application starts with the generation of (n,8) random numbers between
0.0 and 1.0, and where n is the number of text strings that will be displayed.
The 8 random numbers for each case are use as follows:

- 0, 1: the relative position on the canvas viewport,
- 2: the relative font size, ranging from 12 to 48,
- 3, 4, 5: the color (resp. red, green and blue components),
- 6: the text to be shown, selected from a list of predefined texts,
- 7: the font to be used, also selected from a list of fonts.

The texts are shown one by one, with a small pause between.
During the display of the first half of the set of texts,
the previous text is removed after each new one is shown.
During the second half, all texts remain on the canvas.
