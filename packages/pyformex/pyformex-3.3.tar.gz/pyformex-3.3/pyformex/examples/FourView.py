"""FourView.py

Demonstrate multiple views of same contents. It display a model of a man,
with front, right, top and isometric views. The first three feature a
camera with locked viewing direction, but zooming is possible. The last
viewport has a completely free camera.

Note: This is a feature under development. Currently you need to construct
the scene first and then set/lock the layout.
