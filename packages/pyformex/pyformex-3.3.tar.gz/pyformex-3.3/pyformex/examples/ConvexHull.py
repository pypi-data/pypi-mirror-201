"""ConvexHull

This example demonstrates the use of the Coords.convexHull method.
You need to have the python-scipy version 0.12.0 or higher to run this
example.

The example creates a set of random points in space, and then constructs
and draws the 3D convex hull of the points, as well as the 2D
convex hulls of the points projected on each of the coordinate planes.

Switch off perspective and look along one of the global axis directions
to see the 2D hulls matching.
