"""BezierSpline

This example shows a collection of Bezier Spline curves through a number of
points. The points used are the corners and midside points of a unit square.
The user is asked for a number of points to use.
The image shows open (left) and closed (right) BezierSpline curves of
degrees 1(red), 2(magenta) and 3(blue).
