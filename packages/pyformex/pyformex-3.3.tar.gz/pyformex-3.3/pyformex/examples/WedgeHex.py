"""WedgeHex

This example illustrates the creation of geometry by a revolution around
an axis and the automatic reduction of the resulting degenerate elements
to lower plexitude.

First a 2D rectangular quad mesh is created. It is then revolved around an axis
cutting the rectangle. The result is a fan shaped volume of hexahedrons,
of which some elements are degenerate (those touching the axis). The
splitDegenerate method is then used to split the mesh in nondegenerat meshes
of Wedge6 (magenta) and Hex8 (cyan) type.
