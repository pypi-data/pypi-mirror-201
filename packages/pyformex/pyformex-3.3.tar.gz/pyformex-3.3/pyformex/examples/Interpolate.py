"""Interpolate

This examples illustrates the working of the 'interpolate' method.

First, two lines are created, each one consisting of two line segments.
Then new lines are created by interpolating between the two.
Next, an interpolation is created with the element order swapped.
Finally, the lines are subdivided in smaller segments.
