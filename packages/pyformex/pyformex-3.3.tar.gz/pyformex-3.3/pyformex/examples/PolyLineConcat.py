"""PolyLineConcat

Example showing the use of the PolyLine concatenate method.

#. The example first creates a list of three PolyLines (identical, but with
   an offset in x-direction. (Top row)
#. The three PolyLines are simply concatenated to a single PolyLine.
   (Second row)
#. The middle of the three PolyLines is reversed (so that it starts at top
   right and ends at bottom left) and the three are concatenated again.
   (Third row)
#. The same three Polylines are concatenated with the `smart=True`
   parameter. Notice how the concatenation has selected the closest point
   for the concatenation. (Last row)
