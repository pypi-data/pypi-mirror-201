"""MeshMatch

This example illustrates the Mesh.match method.
It first constructs two Meshes: one with squares (red) and one with
triangles (green). Then it finds the nodes from the second that coincide
with nodes from the first. The matching nodes are marked with black
squares. The matching node numbers from the two meshes are printed out.

Then, after a pause, the parts of both meshes that are connected to the
common nodes are drawn.
