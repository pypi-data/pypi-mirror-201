"""Timer class.

import time

class Timer():
    """A class for measuring elapsed time.

    The Timer class is a conventient way to measure and report the elapsed
    time during some processing. It uses Python's :func:`time.perf_counter`,
    providing the highest resolution available.

    A Timer instance can be used as a context manager, with automatic
    reading and even reporting the time spent in the context block.
    Timers can also remember any number of measured timings and report
    them later.

    The Timer value is a floating point value giving a number of seconds
    elapsed since some undefined reference point. By default this is the
    moment of creation of the Timer, but the starting point can be set at
    any time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tag: str, optional
        A label identifying the current measurement. It is used as the key
        to store the value in the Timer memory, and it is printed out together
        with the value when printing the Timer.
    dec: int, optional
        The number of decimals that will be shown or remembered. The default
        (6) provides microsecond accuracy, which is more than enough for
        all purposes.
    start: float, optional
        The starting time of the Timer. If provided, it is normally a value
        obtained from another Timer instance or from :func:`time.perf_counter`.
        If not provided, the time of the initialization of the Timer is used.
    auto: bool, optional
        If True, the value of the Timer will be printed on exit of the
        context manager. Also, the default value for acc becomes False.
        This is very convenient to quickly do timing to some code block.
        See Examples.
    acc: bool, optional
        If True, values read from the Timer are accumulated under the tag
        value. If False, the read value overwrites the value under the tag.
        The default is True if ``acc`` is False, and False is ``acc`` is True.

    Examples
    --------
    The examples use :func:`time.sleep` to provide a code block
    with some known execution time.

    >>> from time import sleep

    The Timer class acts as a context manager, so it can be used in a
    with statement. This is the recommended way to use the Timer.
    It measures the time spent in the block inside the with clause.

    >>> t = Timer()
    >>> with t:
    ...     sleep(0.2)
    >>> print(t)
    Timer: 0.20... sec.

    Printing out the Timer value after measurement is so common, that
    there is an option to do it automatically. Just set the auto mode on
    (it can also be done at instantiation time):

    >>> t.auto = True
    >>> sleep(0.05)
    >>> with t:
    ...     sleep(0.12)
    Timer: 0.32... sec.

    Notice that the Timer accumulated the measured time with the previous.
    This is the default.You can avoid the accumulation by using separate tags
    for the measurements.

    >>> with t.tag('New tag'): sleep(0.23)
    New tag: 0.23... sec.

    Without a tag, the measurement is accumulated to the last specified tag:
    >>> with t: sleep(0.15)
    New tag: 0.38... sec.

    You can switch off accumulation completely if you want to:

    >>> t1 = Timer(dec=2, auto=True, acc=False)
    >>> with t1: sleep(0.06)
    Timer: 0.06 sec.
    >>> with t1: sleep(0.09)
    Timer: 0.09 sec.

    The Timer remembers the last value (accumulated or not) for each of
    the tags that was used. This is very convenient to do a series of
    measurements and then print the Timer :meth:`report`:

    >>> print(t.report())
    Timer: 0.32... sec.
    New tag: 0.38... sec.

    If you want to process the readings in another way, you can access
    them from the Timer memory, which is a dict with the tags a keys:

    >>> print(t.mem)
    {'Timer': 0.32..., 'New tag': 0.38...}

    The last memory item (the one with the current tag) is also available:

    >>> print(t.last)
    New tag: 0.38... sec.

    All Timers keep incrementing at the same pace (that of the unique Python
    :func:`time.perf_counter` counter). So you may think that using a single
    Timer with different tags may suffice. However, to do nested measurements
    with the context manager, you have to use multiple Timers, because our
    context manager is currently not reentrant. So, the following doesn't
    work:

    >>> with Timer("Outer block") as t:
    ...    sleep(0.08)
    ...    with t.tag("Inner block"): sleep(0.12)
    ...    sleep(0.07)
    ...    with t.tag("Inner block 2"): sleep(0.17)
    ...    sleep(0.06)
    ...
    >>> print(t.report())
    Inner block: 0.12... sec.
    Inner block 2: 0.40... sec.

    See how the timings from the outer block are added to the
    "Inner block 2" tag and there is no "Outer block" result at all.
    The correct way to do nested measurement is using multiple Timers:

    >>> with Timer("Outer block") as t:
    ...    sleep(0.08)
    ...    with Timer("Inner block") as t1: sleep(0.12)
    ...    sleep(0.07)
    ...    with t1.tag("Inner block 2"): sleep(0.05)
    ...    sleep(0.06)
    ...
    >>> print(t1.report())
    Inner block: 0.12... sec.
    Inner block 2: 0.05... sec.
    >>> print(t.report())
    Outer block: 0.38... sec.

    There may be times when the use of a context manager is not useful
    or even possible (like when the start and end of measurement are in
    different functions). Then you can always use the low level interface.

    The measurement is always done with the :meth:`read` method. It measures
    and returns the time since the last :meth:`reset` or the creation of the
    Timer. Here is an example:

    >>> t = Timer(dec=2)
    >>> sleep(0.03)
    >>> v = t.read()
    >>> sleep(0.05)
    >>> t.reset()
    >>> sleep(0.07)
    >>> v1 = t.read()
    >>> print(v, v1)
    0.03... 0.07...

    As we use a single tag, the memory shows the accumulated result:

    >>> print(t.mem)
    {'Timer': 0.10...}

    You can have a peek at the current value of the timer, without
    actually reading it:

    >>> sleep(0.07)
    >>> t.value
    0.14...
    >>> print(t.last)
    Timer: 0.1 sec.

    Any read will however update the current tag:

    >>> v = t.read()
    >>> print(v)
    0.14...
    >>> print(t.last)
    Timer: 0.24 sec.

    When not explicitely calling :meth:`read` (like when using the context
    manager), you can still get the last value read:

    >>> print(t.lastread)
    0.14...
