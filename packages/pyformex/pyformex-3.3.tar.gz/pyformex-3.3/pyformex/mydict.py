"""Extensions to Python's built-in dict class.

Dict is a dictionary with default values and alternate attribute syntax.
CDict is a Dict with lookup cascading into the next level Dict's
if the key is not found in the CDict itself.

The classes have been largely reimplemented in 2019, because many of the
reasons for choosing the old implementation are not valid anymore because
of improved features of Python. And the migration to Python3 showed the
shortcomings of an implementation that was too hackishly meddling with
Python internals. Now we have a much cleaner and simpler implementation
while still preserving the intended functionality.

class Dict(defaultdict):

    """A dictionary with default lookup and attribute and call syntax.

    :class:`Dict` is a dictionary class providing extended functionality
    over the builtin Python :class:`dict` class:

    - Items can not only be accessed with dictionary key syntax, but also
      with attribute and call syntax. Thus, if ``C`` is a :class:`Dict`,
      an item with key 'foo' can be obtained in any of the following
      equivalent ``C['foo']``, ``C.foo``, ``C('foo')``. The attribute syntax
      can of course only be used if the key is a string that is valid as
      Python variable.
      The first two can also be used to set the value in the Dict:
      ``C['foo'] = bar``, ``C.foo = bar``. The call syntax does not
      allow setting a value. See however the :class:`Attributes` subclass
      for a dict that does allow ``C(foo=bar)`` to set values.

    - A default_factory function can be provided to handle missing keys.
      The function is then passed the missing key and whatever it returns
      is returned as the value for that key. Note that this is different
      from Python's :class:`defaultdict`, where the default_factory does
      not take an argument and can only return a constant value.
      Without default_factory, the Dict will still produce a KeyError on
      missing keys.

    - Because the Dict accepts call syntax to lookup keys, another Dict
      instance can perfectly well be used as default_factory. You can even
      create a chain of Dict's to lookup missing keys.

    - An example default_factory is provided which returns None for any
      key. Using this default_factory will make the Dict accept any key
      and just return None for the nonexistent keys.

    Parameters
    ----------
    default_factory: callable, optional
        If provided, missing keys will be looked up by a call to the
        default_factory.
    args, kargs: other arguments
        Any other arguments are passed to the dict initialization.

    Notes
    -----
    Watch for this syntax quirks when initializing a Dict:

    - ``Dict()``: an empty Dict without default_factory
    - ``Dict(callable)``: an empty Dict with callable as default_factory
    - ``Dict(noncallable)``: a Dict without default_factory initialized with
      data fron noncallable (e.g. a dict or a sequence of tuples)
    - ``Dict(callable,noncallable)``: a Dict with callable as default_factory
      and initialized with data fron noncallable.

    And since a Dict is callable, but a dict is not, Dict(some_dict) will
    initialize the data in the Dict, while Dict(some_Dict) will use
    ``some_dict`` as defaults, but stay empty itself.

    If a default_factory is provided, all lookup mechanisms (key, attribute,
    call) will use it for missing keys. The proper way to test whether a key
    actually exists in the Dict (and not in the default_factory) is using the
    'key in Dict' operation.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = Dict()
    >>> A
    Dict({})
    >>> A['a'] = 0
    >>> A.b = 1
    >>> # A(c=2) # not allowed
    >>> A
    Dict({'a': 0, 'b': 1})
    >>> sorted(A.keys())
    ['a', 'b']
    >>> 'c' in A
    False
    >>> A.default_factory is None   # A does have a default_factory attribute
    True

    Now a Dict with a default_factory.

    >>> B = Dict(Dict.returnNone,A)   # The dict is initialized with the values of A
    >>> B
    Dict({'a': 0, 'b': 1})
    >>> sorted(B.keys())
    ['a', 'b']
    >>> 'c' in B
    False
    >>> B['c'] is None   # lookup nonexistent key returns None
    True
    >>> B.c is None
    True
    >>> B('c') is None
    True
    >>> B.get('c','Surprise?')  # get() does not use default_factory!
    'Surprise?'

    Using another Dict as default_factory

    >>> C = Dict(A,{'b':5, 'c':6})   # Now A is used for missing keys
    >>> C
    Dict({'b': 5, 'c': 6})
    >>> sorted(C.keys())
    ['b', 'c']
    >>> 'a' in C, 'b' in C, 'c' in C        # 'a' is not in C
    (False, True, True)
    >>> C['a'], C['b'], C['c']         # but still returns a value
    (0, 5, 6)
    >>> C('a'), C('b'), C('c')         # also with call syntax
    (0, 5, 6)
    >>> C.a, C.b, C.c                  # or as attributes
    (0, 5, 6)
    >>> hasattr(C,'a')           # hasattr uses default_factory
    True
    >>> getattr(C,'a',None)      # getattr too
    0
    >>> 'a' in C                 # the proper way to test if key exists in C

    Notes
    -----
    If there are multiple Mapping values in the CDict containing the
    missing key, it is undefined which one will be used to return a
    value. CDict's are therefore usually used where the Mapping values
    have themselves separate sets of keys.

    If any of the values in the CDict is also a CDict, the lookup of missing
    keys will continue in the Mapping values of that CDict. This results
    in a cascading lookup as long as the Mapping types in the values as
    CDict (and not Dict or dict). This is another way of creating chained
    lookup mechanisms (besides using a Dict as default_factory).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> C = CDict(a=0, d={'a':1, 'b':2})
