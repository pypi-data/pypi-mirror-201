# The TriSurface class

@utils.pzf_register
class TriSurface(Mesh):
    """A class representing a triangulated 3D surface.

    A triangulated surface is a surface consisting of a collection of
    triangles. The TriSurface is subclassed from :class:`~mesh.Mesh` with a
    fixed plexitude of 3.
    The surface contains `ntri` triangles and `nedg` edges. Each triangle
    has 3 vertices with 3 coordinates. The total number of vertices is
    `ncoords`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args:
        Data to initialize the TriSurface. This can be 1, 2 or 3 arguments
        specifying one the the following data sets:

        - an (ntri,3,3) :term:`array_like` specifying the coordinates of
          the vertices of the triangles,
        - a :class:`~formex.Formex` with plexitude 3,
        - a :class:`~mesh.Mesh` with plexitude 3,
        - an (ncoords,3) :term:`coords_like` with the vertex coordinates
          and an (ntri,3) int :term:`array_like` specifying three vertex indices
          for each of the triangles
        - an (ncoords,3) :term:`coords_like` with the vertex coordinates,
          an (nedg,2) int :term:`array_like` specifying the vertex inidices
          of the edges, and an (ntri,3) int :term:`array_like` specifying
          the edge indices of the triangles.

    prop: int :term:`array_like`, optional
        This keyword argument can be used to attribute property values to
        the elements of the TriSurface, like in the :class:`~mesh.Mesh` class.

        model: 'C' | 'W' | 'X' | 'A' | 'V'
            Defines how the mass is distributed over the model.

            - 'C': The mass of each triangle is concentrated at
              the centroid of the triangle. This is the default.
            - 'W': The mass of each triangle is concentrated at the nodes
              of the triangles, attributing ont third to each.
            - 'X': The mass is concentrated at the nodes, attributing an
              equal share of the total mass to each of them.
            - 'A': The mass is evenly distributed over the triangles. This
              is currently not implemented!
            - 'V', the mass is evenly distributed over the volume inside
              the surface.

        density: float
            A constant density (mass per unit area, or mass per unit volume
            with ``model='V'``. This allows the returned inertia values to
            be realistic.

        Returns
        -------
        :class:`~inertia.Inertia`
            An Inertia instance with the following attributes:

            - mass: the total mass (float)
            - ctr:: the center of mass: float (3,)
            - tensor: the inertia tensor in the central axes: shape (3,3)

        Notes
        -----
        The 'A' model is currently not implemented. The 'C' model
        neglects the inertia of each triangle around its own centroid.

        It is currently not possible to specify variable density.

        Examples
        --------
        This is an approximation of a spherical surface with radius R=1.
        A perfect spherical surface with density 1 has a mass
        ``M = 4 ÏR^2 = 12.566...`` and a rotational inertia
        ``2/3 MR^2 = 8.377...``.

        >>> from pyformex.simple import sphere
        >>> S = sphere(8)
        >>> I = S.inertia()
        >>> print(I.mass)
        12.50...
        >>> print(I.tensor)
        [[ 8.2735  0.     -0.    ]
         [ 0.      8.2735  0.    ]
         [-0.      0.      8.2735]]

        The results are smaller than the theoretical, because the nodes
        are on the sphere, but the triangle centroids are slightly inside.
        Therefore, concentrating the mass at the nodes gives better results.

        >>> I = S.inertia(model='X')
        >>> print(I.mass)
        12.50...
        >>> print(I.tensor)
        [[ 8.3375  0.     -0.    ]
         [ 0.      8.3375  0.    ]
         [-0.      0.      8.3375]]

        Let's use an area-equivalent spherical approximation instead: this
        has the nodes slightly outside the sphere and the centroids inside.
        As expected, it delivers the correct mass.

        >>> SA = sphere(8, equiv='A')
        >>> I = SA.inertia()
        >>> print(I.mass)
        12.566...
        >>> print(I.tensor)
        [[ 8.3533 -0.     -0.    ]
         [-0.      8.3533 -0.    ]
         [-0.     -0.      8.3533]]

        Considered as a volume, the mass of a perfect sphere is
        4/3 ÏR^2 = 4.188... and the inertia is 2/5 MR^2 = 1.675....

        >>> I = S.inertia(model='V')
        >>> print(I.mass)
        4.1526...
        >>> print(I.tensor)
        [[ 1.6515  0.     -0.    ]

         [-0.     -0.      1.6515]]

        With a volume-equivalent model, we get:

        >>> SV = sphere(8, equiv='V')
        >>> I = SV.inertia(model='V')
        >>> print(I.mass)

        Parameters
        ----------
        method: 'admesh' | 'internal'
            The method to be used. If not specified, the default 'internal'
            is used and a warning is shown about the changed default.
            The 'internal' method does not rely on external software, and is
            relatively fast. As it does not fuse the nodes nor compacts the
            node array, it guarantees that the numbering of nodes and elements

            The 'admesh' uses an external program and needs to write the
            surface to a file and read it back. This method will always
            do a fuse and compaction, so if the surface was not fused and
            compacted before the call, the result may have different node
            and/or element numberings.
        outwards: bool
            If True (default), a test is done whether the surface is a closed
            manifold, or a set of closed manifolds, and if so, the normals are
            oriented outwards. Setting this value to False may result in a
            closed surfaces with all normals pointing inside.

def fillBorder(border, method='radial', dir=None):
    """Create a triangulated surface inside a given closed polygonal line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    border: :class:`PolyLine`, :class:`Mesh` or :class:`Coords`
        A closed polygonal line that forms the border of the triangulated
        surface to be created. The polygon does not have to be planar.
        The line can be provided as one of the following:

        - a closed PolyLine,
        - a 2-plex Mesh, with a Connectivity table such that the elements
          in the specified order form a closed polyline,
        - a simple Coords holding the subsequent vertices of the polygonal
          border line.
    method: str
        Specifies the algorithm to be used to fill the polygon. Currently
        available are:

        - 'radial': this method adds a central point and connects all border
          segments with the center to create triangles.
        - 'border': this method creates subsequent triangles by connecting the
          endpoints of two consecutive border segments and thus works its way
          inwards until the hole is closed. Triangles are created at the line
          segments that form the smallest angle.
        - 'planar': this method projects the border on a plane, fills the
          border in 2D, then maps that back to the original border.
          The projection direction can be specified with ``dir``.

        See also Notes below.
    dir: (3,) :term:`array_like`, optional
        A vector specyfing the direction of the projection in the case of
        ``method='planar'``. If not provided, the best direction is
        automatically choosen.


    Returns
    -------
    TriSurface
        A TriSurface filling the hole inside the border.

    Notes
    -----
    The 'radial' method produces nice results if the border is relative smooth,
    nearly convex and nearly planar. It adds an extra point though, which may
    be unwanted. On irregular 3D borders there is a high change that the
    resulting TriSurface contains intersecting triangles.

    The 'border' method is slower on large borders, does not introduce any
    new point and has a better chance of avoiding intersecting triangles
    on irregular 3D borders.

    The 'planar' method gives very good results if the border curve is more
    or less planar.

    The resulting surface can be checked for intersecting triangles with the
    :meth:`check` method.

def instant_meshes(infile, outfile=None, **kargs):
    """Remesh a tri3 mesh to a quality tri3 and/or quad4 mesh

    Uses the external 'Instant Meshes' program to remesh a tri3 mesh
    to a tri3 and/or quad4 mesh of the desired quality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    infile: :term:`path_like`
        An .obj file containing a pure tri3 mesh.
    outfile: :term:`path_like`
        The output file with the quad (or quad dominated) Mesh.
        It can be a .obj or .ply file. If not provided, it is generated
        from the input file with the '.obj' suffix replaced 'with _quad.obj'.
    threads: int
        Number of threads to use in parallel computations.
    deterministic: bool
        If True, prefer (slower) deterministic algorithms. Default False.
    crease: float
        Dihedral angle threshold for creases.
    smooth: int
        Number of smoothing & ray tracing reprojection steps (default: 2).
        Setting this to 0 may result in degenerate quads (with two adjacent
        edges along the same line).
    dominant: bool
        If True, generate a quad dominant mesh instead of a pure quad mesh.
        The output may contain some triangles and pentagones as well.
        Default False.
    intrinsic: bool
        If True, use intrinsic mode (extrinsic is the default).
    boundaries: bool
        If True, align the result on the boundaries. Default False.
        Only applies when the surface is not closed.
    posy: 3 | 4 | 6
        Specifies the position symmetry type. Default 4.
    rosy: 2 | 4 | 6
        Specifies the orientation symmetry type. Default 4.
    scale: float
        The intended edge length of the quad elements. Ignored if either
        faces or vertices is provided. See notes.
    faces: int
        The intended number of quads in the output mesh. Ignored if
        vertices is provided. See notes.
    vertices: int
        The intended number of vertices in the output mesh. See notes.

    Returns
    -------
    Path | None
        The path of the output file if the conversion was successful, else None.

    Notes
    -----
    The 'Instant Meshes' executable should be installed as 'instant-meshes'.

    To control the output resolution, one should specify exactly one of
    scale, faces or vertices. These are mutually exclusive.

    If a pure quad mesh is requested (the default), the number of
    faces and vertices is likely to end up being around 4 times larger and
    the edges two times shorter than requested.
    This is because the initial remeshing may end up with some
    triangles and/or pentagons, which then require a subdivision of all faces
    into smaller quads. You may anticipate to this by specifying smaller values.
    This late subdivision is not done if ``dominant=True``
    is specified, or if the initial remesh does not have any triangles or
    pentagons.

    With dominant=False, posy = 3 or 6 results in a Tri3 Mesh, while posy = 4
    yields a Quad4 Mesh. The best quality is usually obtained with posy=rosy=6
    to produce triangles and posy=rosy=4 for quads.

def remesh_instant(S, *, infile=None, outfile=None, nplex=None, **kargs):
    """Create a quality remesh of the TriSurface.

    Uses :func:`instant_meshes` to remesh a TriSurface into a
    quality Tri3 or Quad4 Mesh.

    Parameters
    ----------
    S: TriSurface
        The TriSurface to be remeshed.
    infile: :term:`path_like`
        The name of an .obj file where the TriSurface will be stored for
        processing. If not provided, a temporary file is used.
    outfile: :term:`path_like`
        The name of an .obj file for storing the output Mesh.

    nplex: 3 | 4
        This is a convenient parameter to quickly create a quality mesh

        with values 6 for nplex=3 and 4 for nplex=4.

        Other keyword arguments passed to :func:`instant_meshes`.
        All the keyword parameters accepted by that function,
        except for 'dominant, can be specified here.

    Returns
    -------
    Mesh | None
        A Mesh of eltype 'tri3' or 'quad4' if the conversion was
        successful, or else None.

    Notes
    -----
    If neither scale, faces or vertices is provided, vertices
    will be set equal to the number of vertices in the TriSurface.
    This is because the default of :func:`instant_meshes` results in a
    much too coarse Mesh.

    If the boundaries parameter is not provided, it is set True
    if the TriSurface is not a closed manifold.

    As a side effect, if file names were specified, the .obj files
    with the original TriSurface and remeshed surface remain available.
