Instant Meshes
--------------

Instant Meshes is a program that can remesh a sruface into high
quality triangle and/or quad surfaces.

See https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes for more information.

It is however not (yet?) available as ready-made packages in common
Linux distributions. This directory provides a Makefile that helps
you to install it.

It comes down to the following, and you can also do it by hand, if the
procedure doesn't suit your needs:

- download the program from https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes.
  (comes as a zipped ready to run binary)
- unzip the downloaded file somewhere in an executable path, e.g.
  your ~/bin, if that is in your PATH environment
- rename or symlink the 'Instant Meshes' binary to 'instant-meshes'

In commands::

  $ wget https://instant-meshes.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/instant-meshes-linux.zip
  $ unzip instant-meshes-linux.zip
  $ mv 'Instant Meshes' ~/bin
  $ ln -s 'Instant Meshes' ~/bin/instant-meshes

Then run ``pyFormex --detect`` to see if pyFormex can find it.

# End




CalculiX is a free Finite Element program (http://http://www.calculix.de/)
pyFormex can write input files for CalculiX and postprocess some results.
The following commands will install the CalculiX processor::

  apt install libgfortran4
  make download
  sudo make install

.. End
