Installation procedure for calpy
================================

Calpy is a simple Finite Element framework with a Python interface.
It can easily be interfaced with pyFormex. Some of the examples included
with pyFormex use calpy.

calpy.install will download, compile and install calpy and all that is
needed to let it cooperate with pyFormex.

By default the installation is done under /usr/local and you will need root
privileges to do so.

The full installation can be done with a single command:
(sudo) ./install.sh all

Dependencies:
gfortran
