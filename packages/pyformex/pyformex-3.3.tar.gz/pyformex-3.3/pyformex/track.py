    Parameters
    ----------
    cls: class
        The class to be tracked.
    name: str, optional
        The name of the class wrapper. If not provided, the name
        will be 'Tracked' followed by the capitalized class name.
    methods: list of str
        List of class method names that should be taken into account in

    Returns
    -------
    class
        A class wrapping the input class and tracking access to any of
        the specified methods. The class has an extra attribute 'hits'
        counting the number accesses to one of these methods.
