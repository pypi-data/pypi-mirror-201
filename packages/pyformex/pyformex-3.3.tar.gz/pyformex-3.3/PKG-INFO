Description: pyFormex is a Python framework to create, transform, manipulate and render
        geometrical models of 3D structures by sequences of mathematical
        operations. Unlike traditional CAD systems, pyFormex uses a powerful
        Python based scripting language as the basic user input method, making
        it very well suited for automated and repeated (parametric) design
        procedures. It provides a wide range of operations on surface meshes,
        like STL type triangulated surfaces, and FEA meshes or CFD grids.
        There is also support for NURBS curves and surfaces.
        
        pyFormex is often used to create 3D models from medical scan images,
        or as a pre- and post-processor for FEA programs.
        But it can just as well be used to create some nice 3D renderings.
        The fully open Python scripting allows you to do just about anything,
        including interfacing with many other softwares and extending the program
        to suit your own needs. You are only limited by your own imagination.
        
        In pyFormex, the topology of the elements can be created separately
        from the final geometrical form. Often, topology is created first and
        then mapped onto some real geometry. Through the scripting language,
        the user can define any sequence of transformations, built from provided
        or user defined functions. Since the model is stored as a script,
        building parametric models is a natural thing.
        
        While pyFormex is always under development, its scripting language has
        become fairly stable. Its OpenGL GUI environment allows for displaying,
        manipulating and exporting the generated structures.
