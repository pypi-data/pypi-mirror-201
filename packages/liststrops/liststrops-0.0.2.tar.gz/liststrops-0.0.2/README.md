This is a package for learning how to use PyPi and pip.

It comes with four simple functions: arop, star, arst, and rale.

arop(Function, List), performs given Function on given List and returns new list, do not include "()" on Function.

star(String), converts a string to a list and returns list.

arst(List), converts a list to a string and returns string.

rale(List), shortcut for range(len(list)).
