Infinitesimal Quest 2 + ε
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Infinitesimal Quest 2 + ε (or "SQ" for short; Python package name ``simalq``) is an in-progress, not-yet-playable Gauntlet-like turn-based puzzling dungeon crawler written to serve as an official example program for `Hy <http://hylang.org>`_. It's a reimplementation / remake / demake of `Yves Meynard <http://yvesmeynard.com>`_'s 1996 Macintosh game Infinity Quest II, abbreviated "IQ". SQ is planned to feature:

- Playability on any platform with Python 3 and a compatible terminal emulator
- Glorious roguelike-like console display, with no distracting graphics, sounds, or mouse support
- Oodles of monsters, magic items, and tricky terrain
- Deterministic, full-information gameplay
- Undo with infinite history
- Compatibility with quest (level) files in IQ's binary format
- An extensive test suite

Usage
============================================================

There's no user interface yet, but you can run the tests with the command ``pytest``.

The first time that SQ requires IQ's original quests, it will download them automatically. The download is cached, so no Internet connection is needed afterwards.

The story so far
============================================================

Her Royal Highness Princess Triskaidecagonn XIII (whose friends call her "Tris"), tiring of her studies, shut the heavy grimoire of nonstandard analysis. "For too long I have been obliged to concern myself with tedious scholarship," she lamented aloud, "while my older brother Argonn has sallied forth on many an heroic quest. Here I sit, idling, with nary an opportunity to test my own skills in the sword, the bow, and the sliding-block puzzle."

"Aha!" cried the fell wizard Idok, deep in his underground laboratory, who had been spying on the princess through his mystical Macintosh LC so he could copy her homework answers. "Here is an opportunity to teach you, young princess, to be careful what you wish for." He typed a dread incantation in Hy, the long-dead language of squids born of snakes, and in a swarm of foul parentheses, Tris was carried off to a vast dungeon deep beneath the faraway elven land of Québec. The place looked familiar, and Tris realized that Idok had plagiarized pretty much the whole thing from the thesis of his doctoral advisor, the wicked sorcerer Karvarel. Her brother had braved these very dungeons years ago. She didn't have his memoirs handy, but she did know one really good magic spell, which allowed her to predict the future. Now, with this clairvoyance, her trusty sword and bow, and anything handy she happens to find lying around, Tris must escape the dungeon or die in the attempt. And if she can stuff her pockets with loot on the way, that would really help with her kingdom's latest financial crisis.

Differences from IQ
============================================================

Apart from cosmetic and other interface differences, the chief way SQ differs from IQ in its design is its commitment to determinism. SQ replaces IQ's random mechanics, such as monster pathfinding, with deterministic equivalents, sometimes making aspects of the game stateful that were previously stateless. SQ also deliberately omits interface hijinks like darkness and confusion. SQ adds mid-game saving and loading, undo, visibility of the map outside the hero's shooting radius, fixes to bugs and weird behavior (e.g., winning with a "you have died message" if you win the game and die to poison on the same turn), removal of many engine limits (e.g., max and min level size), and the ability to adjust some core game rules (e.g., whether monsters can walk on items).

While the author of IQ kindly provided me with its source code for reference, SQ is an original work that doesn't substantively copy IQ at the code level, and has many fine differences (deliberate, and probably also accidental) in behavior.
