# MPTT-Reader

A work in progress way to quickly read from an TRISTAR-MPTT-45. Soon there will be added features to logging the data to unique data formats.

If you use the tool, please leave a star, so others can find it too in their search.

You will need `pymodbus` with the `serial` option for this to work correctly.
