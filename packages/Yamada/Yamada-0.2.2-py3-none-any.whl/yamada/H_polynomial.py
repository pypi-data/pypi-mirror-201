P1. H(empty graph) = 1 and H(simple loop) = A + 1 + A^(-1)
P2. H(G_1 disjoint union G_2)      =  H(G_1) * H(G_2)
P3. H(G_1 union G_2)               = -H(G_1) * H(G_2)
P4. If G has a cut edge, then H(G) =  0
P5. Let e be a non-loop edge of graph G. Then H(G) = H(G/e) + H(G-e) where G/e is the graph obtained from G by
    contracting e to a point and G-e is G with e deleted.
