"""*magic* __path__ to support pkgutil namespace packages. This is a compromise
to fully adopting PEP420 implied namespace packaging. This is the most
compatible with Python v2 and v3. While Python v2 is EOL and should not be
a consideration, using PKGUTIL namespace packages is desireable since PEP420
does not currently have wide adoption in dev tools.

! IMPORTANT: Any and all projects using this namespace 'hankai' MUST use some
form of this __path__ manipulation with 'pkgutil'. If not, 'hankai' packages
will break.
