"""
    Unofficial API for Mawaqit.com in Python. You can either scrape the data from the website or load past data from a file.
    To get started, create a Mawaqit object and pass the name of the mosque as a parameter. You can find the name of the mosque in the url of the mawaqit website.
    Example: https://mawaqit.com/essalam-rotterdam
    The name of the mosque is essalam-rotterdam.

    You will mostly interact with the Mawaqit object, found at MawaqitAPI.mawaqit.
