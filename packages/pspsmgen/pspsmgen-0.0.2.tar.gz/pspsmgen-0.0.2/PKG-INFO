# PsPsMGen

Pore-scale Pre-salt Model Generator

PsPsMGen is a based-process pore-scale generator that builds 3d models for simulations such as permeability and resistivity at the pore scale. The core idea is to add the most common components in in-situ Pre-salt rocks, including spherulites, shrubs, and dolomite. In addition, the code also has features to dissolve or replace constituents or build models of spheres.

## Instalation

```
pip install pspsmgen
```

## Examples

Modeling examples can be found in the notebooks Dolostones.ipynb, Spherulstones.ipynb, and Shrubstones.ipynb.
