# CASE Implementation: PROV-O

This repository maps [CASE](https://caseontology.org/) to [W3C PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/).  Note that contrary to other CASE implementations, this maps CASE out to another data model, instead of mapping another data model or tool into CASE.

Full documentation is available at the [project homepage](https://github.com/casework/CASE-Implementation-PROV-O).
