# CASE Implementation: PROV-O

This repository maps [CASE](https://caseontology.org/) to [W3C PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/), and provides a provenance review mechanism.  Note that contrary to other CASE implementations, this maps CASE out to another data model, instead of mapping another data model or tool into CASE.

## Usage

This repository can be installed from PyPI or from source.


### Installing from PyPI

```bash
pip install case-prov
```


### Installing from source

Users who wish to install pre-release versions and/or make improvements to the code base should install in this manner.

1. Clone this repository.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. (Optional) Upgrade `pip` with `pip install --upgrade pip`.  (This can speed installation of some dependent packages.)
4. Run `pip install $x`, where `$x` is the path to the cloned repository.

Local installation is demonstrated in the `.venv.done.log` target of the `tests/` directory's [`Makefile`](tests/Makefile).


### Usage and testing

The [tests](tests/) directory demonstrates the three standalone scripts run against CASE example JSON-LD data.
* `case_prov_rdf` - This script takes as input one or more CASE graph files, and outputs a graph file that adds annotations to the CASE nodes that serve as a standalone PROV-O graph.
* `case_prov_dot` - This script takes as input one or more PROV-O graph files, and outputs a Dot render.
* `case_prov_check` - This script takes as input one or more graph files, and reviews data for OWL consistency according to PROV-O (e.g. ensuring no one graph individual is a member of two PROV-O disjoint sets), and for breaks in chain of custody.

On using `case_prov_rdf.py` to create a PROV-O graph, it is possible to provide that graph to a PROV-O consumer, such as a [PROV-CONSTRAINTS](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-constraints/) validator.  This CASE project runs a Python package listed on the [W3C 2013 implementations report](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-implementations-20130430/), [`prov-check`](https://github.com/pgroth/prov-check), as part of its sample output.  For instance, the [CASE-Examples repository](https://github.com/casework/CASE-Examples) is analyzed [here](tests/CASE-Examples/examples/prov-constraints.log).

All of the demonstration rendering (to PROV-O and to SVG images) can be run by cloning this repository and running (optionally with `-j`):

```bash
make
```

Be aware that some resources will be downloaded, including [Git submodules](.gitmodules), a Java tool used by the CASE community to normalize Turtle-formatted data, and PyPI packages.  External resources not from PyPI are versioned as Git records.  PyPI packages, [listed](tests/requirements.txt) in the tests directory, are purposefully imported at up-to-date versions instead of locking a specified version.

## Make targets

Some `make` targets are defined for this repository:
* `all` - Build PROV-O mapping files based on CASE examples, and generate figures.
  - **Non-Python dependency** - Figures require [`dot`](https://graphviz.org/) be installed.
* `check` - Run unit tests.
* `clean` - Remove built files.
* `distclean` - Also remove test-installation artifacts.

Note that the `all` and `check` targets will trigger a download of a Java content normalizer, to apply the ontology process described in [CASE's normalization procedures](https://github.com/casework/CASE/blob/master/NORMALIZING.md).


## Design notes

This repository maps CASE to PROV-O by the use of SPARQL `CONSTRUCT` queries, listed [here](case_prov/queries/).

Both direct relationships and qualified relationships are implemented, according to data tied to CASE `InvestigativeAction`s.  For example, [the `CONSTRUCT` query for `prov:actedOnBehalfOf`](case_prov/queries/construct-actedOnBehalfOf.sparql)) directly relates an action's instrument as a delegated agent of the action's performer.  This is built as a qualified, annotatable relationship with [the `CONSTRUCT` query for `prov:Delegation`](case_prov/queries/construct-Delegation.sparql)).

One CASE practice that might look non-obvious in the PROV context is CASE's representation of an initial evidence submission.  CASE represents this by an `InvestigativeAction` that has no inputs.  For a simplification of chain of custody querying, this project represents this as actions that use, and entities that are derived from, the empty set, `prov:EmptyCollection`.  (This is implemented in [this query](case_prov/queries/construct-used-nothing.sparql)).


## Visual-design notes

Some of the tests include small galleries of figures that are tracked as documentation.  Other figures can be generated by an interested user, but are not version-controlled at the moment.

See for example:
* [The CASE website narrative "Urgent Evidence"](tests/casework.github.io/examples/urgent_evidence/)

The following notes describe visual-design decisions.


### Visual-design credits

The `case_prov_dot` module adopts the design vocabulary used by Trung Dong Huynh's MIT-licensed Python project [`prov`](https://github.com/trungdong/prov).  `prov`'s [short tutorial landing page](https://trungdong.github.io/prov-python-short-tutorial.html) illustrates the shape and color selections for various nodes, edges, and annotations.  The `case_prov_dot` program uses this instead of the W3C's design vocabulary, illustrated in [Figure 1 of the PROV-O documentation page](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#starting-points-figure), because of the greater color specificity used for the various between-node-class edges.

The version of `prov` that `case_prov_dot` draws its designs from is tracked as a Git submodule.  This tracking is not for any purpose of importing code.  The [`prov.dot` package](https://github.com/trungdong/prov/blob/2.0.0/src/prov/dot.py) is imported as a library for its styling dictionaries, though this CASE project implements its own dot-formatted render to implement some extending design decisions, some of which are specific to CASE concepts.

[Conventions provided by the W3C](https://www.w3.org/2011/prov/wiki/Diagrams) were found after initial design of this section.  Color selection has not been compared, but directional flow has been adopted.  Notably, **time flows from up to down**, and when compared, **left to right**.  *(Note, though, that left-to-right temporal flow is not yet implemented.)*


### Departures from original visual-design vocabularies


#### Activity-activity edges

Both the illustration in W3C PROV-O's Figure 1, and the edge colors in the `prov` project, assign black to both `wasInformedBy` and `wasDerivedFrom`.  This CASE project opts to distinguish `wasInformedBy` by coloring its edges a shade of blue.


#### Activity labels

Activity labels in this CASE project include the activity's time interval, using closed interval notation for recorded times, and an open interval end with ellipsis for absent times.

![Activity labels with time intervals](figures/readme-activities.svg)


#### Provenance records as collections

A `prov:Collection` is a subclass of a `prov:Entity`.  To distinguish `prov:Collection`s that are CASE `investigation:ProvenanceRecord`s, versus other `prov:Entity`s, a slightly different yellow is used, as well as a different shape.

The label form is also adjusted to include a CASE `exhibitNumber`, when present.

#### Edge weights

The PROV-O model provides direct-relationship predicates, and qualified relationships that *imply* the same direct structure but instead use an annotatable qualification object.  This CASE project illustrates PROV-O direct relationships, but makes one difference from the original `prov` visual-design vocabulary, using edge representation to represent relationship qualifiability.

Take for example this graph, which presents a shortened illustration from the [`prov:Attribution` example](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Attribution):

```turtle
@prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> .

<urn:example:someAgent> a prov:Agent .

<urn:example:someEntity>
  a prov:Entity ;
  prov:wasAttributedTo <urn:example:someAgent> ;
  prov:qualifiedAttribution <urn:example:someAttribution> ;
  .

<urn:example:someAttribution>
  a prov:Attribution ;
  prov:agent <urn:example:someAgent> ;
  .
```

The direct relationship in this graph between `someEntity` and `someAgent` can be expressed in one statement:

```turtle
<urn:example:someEntity> prov:wasAttributedTo <urn:example:someAgent> .
```

The qualified relationship between `someEntity` and `someAgent` requires a path through two statements to link the two together:

```turtle
<urn:example:someEntity> prov:qualifiedAttribution <urn:example:someAttribution> .
<urn:example:someAttribution> prov:agent <urn:example:someAgent> .
```

The `prov:wasAttributedTo` predicate can be mechanically derived, by running a `CONSTRUCT` query that builds the predicate from the path `?nEntity prov:qualifiedAttribution/prov:agent ?nAgent`.  Since the `Attribution` object can also be further annotated in analysis, this project considers creation of an `Attribution` a stronger mapping of object relationships in CASE to PROV-O.

On the other hand, there may be times when the CASE mapping into PROV-O can provide the direct relationship, but not the qualified relationship.  This project considers this a weaker mapping of an object relationship in CASE to PROV-O, but still worth illustrating.

To illustrate the difference in projective capability of the subject CASE instance data, a solid line is used to represent when a qualified relationship was constructed from the CASE instance data.  A dashed line is used to represent when a direct relationship was constructed, but the qualified relationship could not be constructed.  This figure presents a variant on the above example, with the source data in [`readme-attribution.ttl`](figures/readme-attribution.ttl):
