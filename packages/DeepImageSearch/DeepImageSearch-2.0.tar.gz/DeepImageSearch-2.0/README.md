## Developed By

### [Nilesh Verma](https://nileshverma.com "Nilesh Verma")

## Features
- Faster Search **O(logN)** Complexity.
- High Accurate Output Result.
- Best for Implementing on python based web application or APIs.
- Best implementation for College students and freshers for project creation.
- Applications are Images based E-commerce recommendation, Social media and other image-based platforms that want to implement image recommendation and search.

## Installation

This library is compatible with both *windows* and *Linux system* you can just use **PIP command** to install this library on your system:

```shell
pip install DeepImageSearch
```

If you are facing any VS C++ 14 related issue in windows during installation, kindly refer to following solution: [Pip error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44951456/pip-error-microsoft-visual-c-14-0-is-required "Pip error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required")

## How To Use?

We have provided the **Demo** folder under the *GitHub repository*, you can find the example in both **.py** and **.ipynb**  file. Following are the ideal flow of the code:

### 1. Importing the Important Classes
There are three important classes you need to load **LoadData** - for data loading, **Index** - for indexing the images to database/folder, **SearchImage** - For searching and Plotting the images

```python
# Importing the proper classes
from DeepImageSearch import Index,LoadData,SearchImage
```

### 2. Loading the Images Data

For loading the images data we need to use the **LoadData** object, from there we can import images from the CSV file and Single/Multiple Folders.

```python
# load the Images from the Folder (You can also import data from multiple folders in python list type)
image_list = LoadData().from_folder(['images','wiki-images'])
# Load data from CSV file
image_list = LoadData().from_csv(csv_file_path='your_csv_file.csv',images_column_name='column_name')
```
### 3. Indexing and Saving The File in Local Folder

For faster retrieval we are using tree-based indexing techniques for Images features, So for that, we need to store meta-information on the local path **[meta-data-files/]** folder.

```python
# For Faster Serching we need to index Data first, After Indexing all the meta data stored on the local path
Index(image_list).start()
```
### 3. Searching

Searching operation is performed by the following method:

```python
# for searching, you need to give the image path and the number of the similar image you want
SearchImage().get_similar_images(image_path=image_list[0],number_of_images=5)
```
you can also plot some similar images for viewing purpose by following the code method:

```python
# If you want to plot similar images you can use this method, It will plot 6 most similar images from the data index
SearchImage().plot_similar_images(image_path = image_list[0],number_of_images=6)
```
