# InsuLearner: Estimating Insulin Pump Settings with Machine Learning

### _Warning_:
*_This code can have significant impact on insulin dosing. 
There are no guardrails included here so it's possible to get poor
results in some circumstances.
Check with your doctor before making any changes to dosing settings._*


### Overview:

This is the code underlying [my article](https://www.CameronSummers.com/how_I_calculate_my_sons_insulin_pump_settings_with_machine_learning) 
where I describe in plain language the machine learning approach I developed to compute 
the insulin pump settings for my son.

This library estimates personalized insulin pump settings from historical insulin
and carbohydrate information. Currently, it interfaces with [Tidepool](https://www.tidepool.org)
accounts to retrieve data.

The code uses machine learning to estimate:

- Carbohydate Ratio (CIR)
- Basal Rate
- Insulin Sensivity Factor (ISF)

Historical carbohydrate and insulin data directly estimate CIR and Basal 
Rate using Linear Regression. An estimate of Carbohydrate Sensitivity Factor 
(CSF) and the estimate CIR is used to estimate ISF.

Here is an example plot of a fitted model and estimated settings:

## Dependencies

Developed and tested with Python 3.9

## Installation

For easy CLI tool create a virtual environment and then run:
```
pip install insulearner
```

For digging into the code to understand what's going on (recommended):

```
git clone https://github.com/scaubrey/InsuLearner
```

## Usage (CLI)

The install with pip provides a command line interface so you can run `insulearner`.

#### CLI Examples

If you don't know your Carbohydrate Sensitivity Factor (CSF) I devised
an estimator based on height and weight. Note: this estimator is an
educated guess and *not validated*. It's probably better if you estimate
it yourself.

`insulearner <your_tidepool_email> <your_tidepool_password> --num_days 60 --height_inches 72 --weight_lbs 200 --gender male`

If you do have an estimate of your CSF through your own testing:

`insulearner <your_tidepool_email> <your_tidepool_password> --num_days 60 --CSF 4.2`

#### More CLI Options

`--agg_period_window_size_hours` This is the size of the time period in days over which
aggregate insulin and carb data. I theorized in [my article](https://www.cameronsummers.com/how_I_calculate_my_sons_insulin_pump_settings_with_machine_learning) 
that longer periods would converge to better estimates of CIR and Basal Rate. Default
is 1 day (24 hours) but I have seen good results with many more days.

`--agg_period_hop_size_hours` This is how much to shift over the aggregation
window for each data point. For example, if the window size above is 72 hrs 
and this is 24 hours, then the aggregation for the first data point will be days 1-3, the
second data point will be days 2-4, and the third data point will
be days 3-5, and so on.

`--estimate_agg_boundaries` If set this will use an autocorrelation-like algorithm to
estimate the hour of the day when blood glucose movement is the least active, ie 
isolating associated insulin and carb effects.


## Usage (code)

Once installed with pip, you can use the functions in your code:

```
>>> from InsuLearner.insulearner import analyze_settings_lr
```


## Algorithms

There are three algorithms I developed that are in this code and worth
being aware of:

1. An autocorrelation-like algorithm to find inactive periods in data
    in order to help denoise the data for fitting a model.
2. Linear Regression to estimate Carb Ratio (CIR), Basal Rate, and Insulin
    Sensitivity Factor (ISF)
   1. This is methodology is described in [my article](https://www.CameronSummers.com/how_I_calculate_my_sons_insulin_pump_settings_with_machine_learning).
3. Estimating Carb Sensitivity Factor (CSF)
   1. CSF is used to derive ISF from the estimated CIR from the Linear Regression. 
        It's best to estimate CSF through testing, but I've provided an
        algorithm to approximate it based on blood volume computed via height
        and weight. While based on knowledge of biology this algorithm *has not been validated*. 

## Tests

I included a couple of basic regression tests in the `tests` folder of the code that
can be run with pytest.
