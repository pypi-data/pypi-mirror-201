# üö® Dangermode

## Overview

üö® Dangermode is a ChatGPT Plugin written with Python and FastAPI that allows users to execute code snippets in an IPython session.

‚ö†Ô∏è Dangermode is a proof-of-concept and should not be used in production. It is not secure and should not be used to execute code on a remote server. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Features

- Execute code snippets in an IPython session through ChatGPT.
- Inspect variables and view results in real-time.
- Serve images and display data to ChatGPT.

## Get started, the recommended way

Since you don't want to unleash ChatGPT on your own machine, lab, etc. Build the docker image and run it locally like this:

```
docker build . -t dangermode
docker run -p 8000:8000 -i -t --rm dangermode
```

## (SCARY DANGER MODE) Installation
