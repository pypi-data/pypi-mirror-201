Project Management 
==================

Projects can be created through the main menu of the extension. Creating a new project will result in creating a dedicated project folder in 
the Responsible AI Tracker workspace. Currently, the extension supports either classification or regression projects. Depending on the type of 
project selected during project creation, the metrics shown and tracked in the model comparison table will change to either classification or 
regression metrics. It is also possible to optionally upload an initial notebook to the project. 

Project deletion will lead to deleting all related artifacts and the project folder from the workspace.
