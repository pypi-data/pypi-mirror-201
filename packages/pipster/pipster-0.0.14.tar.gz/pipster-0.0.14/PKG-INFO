## Intro

Install packages using `pip` from inside a python script or console:

```python
>>> from pipster import install
>>> install('useful_package')
```

This tool solves the age-old problem of `pip install`ing a package only to find
that you still can't import it because it was installed for the wrong
interpreter. By installing from inside python, you ensure that it will be
available to import from that instance of python.

## Installation

Run the following in your terminal.

```
$ pip install --user pipster
```

...and if that's not working, you can run this in a python script or console:

```python
import subprocess
import sys
cmd = [sys.executable,  '-m', 'pip', 'install', '--user', 'pipster']
subprocess.check_call(cmd)
```

## Usage

The `install` function can be called in two ways.

#### `install('pip install useful_package')`

If you give `install()` a single string that begins with `pip install`, then it
will run that exact command as if it were given at the command line.

#### `install('useful_package1', 'useful_package2', user=True, ...)`

You can also pass any number of target packages along with commandline
arguments or keyword arguments corresponding to commandline parameters for `pip
install`. For example, all of the following lines have the same result:

```python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
>>> install('pip install -r requirements.txt')
>>> install('-r', 'requirements.txt')
>>> install(r='requirements.txt')
```
