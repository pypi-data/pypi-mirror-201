SysAll is a tool that allows you to retrieve information about the environment, 
such as the name of the operating system, processor, RAM, IP address, MAC address of the machine.

It gathers the functionalities of several libraries such as 
wmi, psutil, platform, getmac, socket in one to facilitate the use/manipulation of environment data
for Python programmers.

### Functions

Returns operating system name, version, release.
~~~python
get_os()
# You can use the arguments of the function to return or not certain elements. By default they are all on True.
# If you put them all on False, the function will return 'None'.
args = name : bool = True, version : bool = True, release : bool = True
~~~


Returns device name
~~~python
get_device_name()
~~~


Returns the name of the account currently connected to the operating system.
~~~python
get_hostname()
~~~


Returns appdata hostname and path
~~~python
get_appdata()
# You can use the arguments of the function to return or not certain elements. By default they are all on True.
# If you put them all on False, the function will return 'None'.
args = hostname : bool = True, appdata_path : bool = True
~~~


Returns the memory size : Mo
~~~python
get_memory()
~~~


Return the processor brand (Intel, AMD), frequency and cores.
~~~python
get_cpu_info()
# You can use the arguments of the function to return or not certain elements. By default they are all on True.
# If you put them all on False, the function will return 'None'.
args = brand: bool = True , cpu_frequency: bool = True, cores: bool = True
~~~


Returns the type of the graphics card
~~~python
get_gpu_info()
# You can use the arguments of the function to return or not certain elements. By default they are all on True.
# If you put them all on False, the function will return 'None'.
args = name: bool = True, ram: bool = True, driver_version: bool = True
~~~


Returns the IPv4 address
~~~python
get_IPv4()
~~~


Returns the MAC address
~~~python
get_MAC()
~~~


Return the public address
~~~python
get_public_ip()
~~~


Return the informations of the disk : total free, used
~~~python
get_disk_infos()
# You can use the arguments of the function to return or not certain elements. By default they are all on True.
# If you put them all on False, the function will return 'None'.
args = path: str = 'C', total : bool = True, free: bool = True, used: bool = True
