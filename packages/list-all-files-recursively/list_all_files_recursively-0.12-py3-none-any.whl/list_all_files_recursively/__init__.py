def get_folder_file_complete_path(folders, maxsubfolders=-1):
    r"""
    This module provides a function to retrieve information about files in a given folder and its subfolders.

    The function get_folder_file_complete_path takes one or more folder paths as input and returns a list of named tuples.
    Each named tuple contains information about a file found in the folder and its subfolders, including the folder path,
    file name, complete file path, and file extension.

    Example usage:
    folders = [r'C:\cygwin', r'C:/cygwinx']
    file_info_list = get_folder_file_complete_path(folders)
    for file_info in file_info_list:
        print(file_info.path)

    Note: This function only works for local file systems and does not support remote file systems.


    Args:
        folders: A string or a list of strings representing folder paths to retrieve file information from.
        maxsubfolders: An optional integer that limits the maximum number of subfolders to search in each folder.

    Returns:
        A list of named tuples. Each named tuple contains information about a file found in the folder and its subfolders,
        including the folder path, file name, complete file path, and file extension.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input folder path is invalid or does not exist.
        TypeError: If the input folders argument is not a string or a list of strings.
