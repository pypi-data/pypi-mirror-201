A python module to submit and monitor scan statuses for static security scanning platforms

### Currently Supported Integrations

- Veracode

### Prerequisites

- Install Make

  For Mac users, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

  `brew install make`

  For Windows users, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)

  `choco install make`

### Project Initialization

- Setup Virtual Environment

  `make init`

    - Activate venv
        - Mac
            - `source venv/bin/activate`
        - Windows
            - `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

  You’ll know the venv is activated since you’ll see (venv) in the terminal

    - To deactivate venv, simply type `deactivate` in the terminal

- Run Tox from the Makefile

  `make verify`

- Auto format Python files to PEP8

  `make fix`

- Clean up Python virtual environments

  `make clean`

### Supported Python Versions

Explicitly tested and supported Python versions can be found in the [tox.ini](tox.ini) file, but
generally this will be the latest 3 versions of Python.

### Usage

**GitHub Action**

```yaml
  - name: Veracode upload for analysis
    uses: JohnDeere/security-scan-invoker@{VERSION}
    with:
      veracode_secret_id: ${{ secrets.VERACODE_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
      veracode_secret_key: ${{ secrets.VERACODE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      package_to_scan: veracode-scanner.zip
      veracode_project_name: "Your_Project_name"
```

**CLI usage:**

`security_scan_invoker --vid <ID> --vkey <KEY> --appname <APPNAME> --filepath <FILEPATH> --version <VERSION>`

**CLI with optional arguments included:**

`security_scan_invoker --vid <ID> --vkey <KEY> --appname <APPNAME> --filepath <FILEPATH> --version <VERSION> --allow_rescan <True> --select_previous_modules <True>`

**Python module import usage:**

``` Python
from security_scan_invoker.main import run_veracode_scanner_app
from security_scan_invoker.scanner_args import ScannerArgs

args = {
   "vid": "<VID>",
   "vkey": "<VKEY>",
   "appname": "<APPNAME>",
   "filepath": "<FILEPATH>",
   "version": "<UNIQUE_VERSION>",
   "allow_rescan": "<ALLOW_RESCAN>",
   "select_previous_modules": "<SELECT_PREVIOUS_MODULES>",
}

exit_code: int = run_veracode_scanner_app(ScannerArgs(args))
```

**Note:** `version` must be unique. One possible way to maintain uniqueness is by setting the
version to `commit hash + job number`.

### FAQ and Common Errors

**Q**: I got an error saying `ERROR: Get app list returned status_code: 401`

**A:** This means the passed API credentials don't have access to the Veracode App Profile

This could be due to any of the following:

1. Veracode credentials aren't properly passed into the build (from GitHub secrets, for instance)
2. Veracode credentials are expired and need to be regenerated. By default, credentials are valid
   for 1 year.
3. The Veracode credentials don't have access to the app profile.

*Note*: Sometimes Veracode returns 401 errors for unknown reasons. This is rare, but may coincide
with a problem in their platform. Check the [Veracode status page](https://status.veracode.com/) to
check the health of their services.

**Q**: I got an error
saying `ERROR: Can't find app called ______ in any of the _____ apps associated with your ID and Key`

**A:** This means that your Veracode credentials were recognized by Veracode but the app wasn't in
the list of apps tied to your credentials.

This could be due to any of the following:

1. The specified app profile doesn't exist in Veracode.
2. Your credentials don't have access to the app.

**Q**: I got an error saying `ERROR: The following build status is not handled: ______`

**A:** This means the previous scan failed and is in a state that needs investigation. It is not
handled automatically by veracode-scanner.
Please [create an issue](https://github.com/JohnDeere/veracode-scanner/issues) on this repository.

**Q:** I got an error
saying `ERROR: You are trying to scan version ______, which is the same version as the previous scan, and it is in a bad state: ______`

**A:** This means that you are re-executing a scan with the same commit as the previous scan, which
is in a bad state. Follow these steps:

1. Scan with a new commit. veracode-scanner will delete the previous bad scan and start a scan on
   the new commit.

**Q:** I got an error
saying `ERROR: We found an issue in deleting the previous scan, which is in a bad state`

**A:** This means veracode-scanner failed to automatically delete the previous scan. Ensure that
your Veracode credentials have `Delete Scans` access.

**Q: I found a bug. What do I do?**

**A:** Submit bug reports and feature requests as
an [issue](https://github.com/JohnDeere/veracode-scanner/issues) on the veracode-scanner repo
