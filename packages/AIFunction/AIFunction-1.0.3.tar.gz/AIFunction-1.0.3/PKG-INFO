# AI Function

Generate realtime AI Functions!

## Installation

To install AI Function, run:

```bash
pip install AIFunction
```

## Usage

To use AIFunction, you must have an OpenAI API key.

Firstly, add a .env file to your project, and add the following:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="key_here"
```

Then, import the aiFunction function:

```python
from AIFunction import aiFunction
```

Now, you can use the aiFunction function to generate AI Functions!

```python
print(aiFunction("bitcoin_price", "Returns the current price of bitcoin."));
# --> 27002.055
```

## What is an AI Function?

Let's say you want to write a function to get the current time in python. All you have to do is:

```python
from AIFunction import aiFunction

print(aiFunction("time", "Returns the current time."));
# --> 12:00:00
```

## How does it work?

AI function uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate the code for the function. It then runs the code and returns the output. If specified, it will also install the required packages for the code.

## Security

AI Functions are not very secure, as they run code without any user testing, and can be used to run malicious code.
