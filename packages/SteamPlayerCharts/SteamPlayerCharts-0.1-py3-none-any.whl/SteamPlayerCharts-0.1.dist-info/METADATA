# SteamCharts

This module makes it possible to get the player count of a game on Steam using the Steamcharts website. It uses aiohttp, BeautifulSoup and http modules.


## Installation

`pip install SteamPlayerCharts`


## Example
```python
import asyncio
import SteamCharts

async def main():
	steamgameID = "4000"
	player_count = await SteamCharts.playercount(steamgameID)
	print(player_count)
	try:
		current_players = player_count['Current Players']
		day_peak = player_count['Peak Players 24h']
		all_time_peak = player_count['Peak Players All Time']
	except:
		error_code = player_count['error']['code']
		error_message = player_count['error']['message']

asyncio.run(main())
```

The playercount function returns a Python dict containing the current player counts, as well as the peak values for the last 24 hours and all time.

If the query fails, an error dict is returned that contains the HTTP error code and message.
