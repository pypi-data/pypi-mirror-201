A small script that allows quickly executing run configurations from the command
line including shell completions.

A run configurations can be any executable placed in a `.run_configs` directory
in any parent of the current working directory. Configurations are always
executed in the directory containing the `.run_configs` folder to get the same
behavior independent of the current working directory.
