`cradmin_resetpassword` --- A password reset workflow
#####################################################

The purpose of the :mod:`django_cradmin.apps.cradmin_resetpassword` app is to provide a
general purpose password reset workflow.

It is designed to work with any user model as long as it
has an ``email`` field or property and a ``set_password``-method
like the Django User model.


*******
Install
*******
Add the following to ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'django_cradmin',
        'django_cradmin.apps.cradmin_generic_token_with_metadata',
        'django_cradmin.apps.cradmin_resetpassword',
    )


And add something like this to your root url config::

    urlpatterns = patterns(
        # ...
        url(r'^resetpassword/', include('django_cradmin.apps.cradmin_resetpassword.urls')),
        # ...
    )



*********
Configure
*********

Required settings:
    DJANGO_CRADMIN_SITENAME
        The name of the site.
        You **must set this setting** unless you override the email subject
        and message templates as explained in :ref:`password_reset_emailtemplates`.

Optional settings:
    DJANGO_CRADMIN_RESETPASSWORD_NO_SUCCESS_MESSAGE
        Set this to `False` to prevent adding a message to ``django.contrib.messages``
        on success. More details in :ref:`password_reset_step_three`.

    DJANGO_CRADMIN_RESETPASSWORD_FROM_EMAIL
        Defaults to the ``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`` setting.

    DJANGO_CRADMIN_RESETPASSWORD_FINISHED_REDIRECT_URL
        The URL to redirect to when the password has been reset.
        Defaults to the ``LOGIN_URL`` setting. More details in :ref:`password_reset_step_three`.


************
How it works
************

Step One --- Send the password reset email
==========================================
If you want an un-authenticated user to reset their password,
you send them to the view named ``cradmin-resetpassword-begin``.

The view asks for an email address using a form. When users post the form,
we send them an email with a link to reset their password. After sending the email,
the view redirects to the view named ``cradmin-resetpassword-email-sent``.


Step two --- Reset the password
===============================
When the user clicks the link provided in the password reset email,
they are redirected to the view named ``cradmin-resetpassword-reset``.

In this view, we ask them to choose a new password, and to repeat the new password.
When we post the form , the password is validated
(see :ref:`password_reset_force_strong_passwords`) and if it validates,
it is updated using the `set_password(raw_password)` method of the
user model.


.. _password_reset_step_three:

Step three --- Redirect the user to some url
============================================
After updating the password, we add:

    Your password has been updated.

to ``django.contrib.messages.success`` and redirect to the url
configured in the ``DJANGO_CRADMIN_RESETPASSWORD_FINISHED_REDIRECT_URL``
setting.

You can set `DJANGO_CRADMIN_RESETPASSWORD_NO_SUCCESS_MESSAGE = False` to prevent
adding a message to ``django.contrib.messages``.

Override the ``cradmin_passwordreset/successmessage.django.html``
template to change the success message.


*****************************************************
About the password reset links and how we secure them
*****************************************************
Password reset links use :doc:`apps.cradmin_generic_token_with_metadata`. This means
that the token at the end of the password reset URL:

- Is random generated and very hard to guess.
- Does not contain any information about the user.

Email templates and how to override them
****************************************
You can override the following templates:

cradmin_passwordreset/email/subject.django.txt
    Override this to set the email subject.

    Template context variables:

    - ``DJANGO_CRADMIN_SITENAME``: The value of the setting with the same name.

cradmin_passwordreset/email/html_message.django.txt
    Override this to change the email message.

    Template context variables:

    - ``DJANGO_CRADMIN_SITENAME``: The value of the setting with the same name.
    - ``reset_url``: The URL that users should click to reset their password.
    - ``user``: The user that is resetting their email.
